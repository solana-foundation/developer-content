Welcome to the Solana developer docs!

This page has everything you need to know to get started with Solana
development, including basic requirements, how Solana development works, and the
tools you'll need to get started.

## High Level Developer Overview

Development on Solana can be broken down into two main parts:

1. **Onchain Program Development**: This is where you create and deploy custom
   programs directly to the blockchain. Once deployed, anyone who knows how to
   communicate with them can use them. You can write these programs in Rust, C,
   or C++. Rust has the most support for onchain program development today.
2. **Client Development**: This is where you write software (called
   decentralized applications, or dApps) that communicates with onchain
   programs. Your apps can submit transactions to perform actions onchain.
   Client development can be written in any programming language.

The "glue" between the client side and the onchain side is the
[Solana JSON RPC API](https://solana.com/docs/rpc). The client-side sends RPC
requests to the Solana network to interact with onchain programs. This is very
similar to normal development between a frontend and backend. The major
difference with working on Solana is that the backend is a global permissionless
blockchain. This means that anyone can interact with your onchain program
without the need of issuing API keys or any other form of permission.

Solana development is a bit different from other blockchains because of its
highly composable onchain programs. This means you can build on top of any
program already deployed, and often you can do so without needing to do any
custom onchain program development. For example, if you wanted to work with
tokens, you could use the [Token Program](/docs/core/tokens.md) that is already
deployed on the network. All development on your application would be
client-side in your language of choice.

Developers looking to build on Solana will find that the development stack is
very similar to any other development stack. The main difference is that you'll
be working with a blockchain and have to think about how users potentially
interact with your application onchain instead of just on the frontend.
Developing on Solana still has CI/CD pipelines, testing, debugging tools, a
frontend and backend, and anything you'd find in a normal development flow.

## What You'll Need Get Started

To get started with Solana development, you'll need different tools based on
whether you are developing for client-side, onchain programs, or both.

### Client-side Development

If you're developing onchain apps, you should know Rust.

If you're developing on the client-side, you can work with any programming
language you're comfortable with. Solana has community-contributed SDKs to help
developers interact with the Solana network in most popular languages :

| Language   | SDK                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RUST       | [solana_sdk](https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/latest/solana_sdk/)                                            |
| Typescript | [@solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)                                       |
| Python     | [solders](https://github.com/kevinheavey/solders)                                                      |
| Java       | [solanaj](https://github.com/skynetcap/solanaj)                                                        |
| C++        | [solcpp](https://github.com/mschneider/solcpp)                                                         |
| Go         | [solana-go](https://github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go)                                                 |
| Kotlin     | [solanaKT](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/SolanaKT) or [sol4k](https://github.com/sol4k/sol4k) |
| Dart       | [solana](https://github.com/espresso-cash/espresso-cash-public/tree/master/packages/solana)            |

You'll also need a connection with an RPC to interact with the network. You can
either work with a [RPC infrastructure provider](https://solana.com/rpc) or
[run your own RPC node](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-an-rpc-node).

To quickly get started with a front-end for your application, you can generate a
customizable Solana scaffold by typing the following into your CLI:

```bash
npx create-solana-dapp <project-name>
```

This will create a new project with all the necessary files and basic
configuration to get started building on Solana. The scaffold will include both
an example frontend and an onchain program template (if you selected one). You
can read the
[`create-solana-dapp` docs](https://github.com/solana-developers/create-solana-dapp?tab=readme-ov-file#create-solana-dapp)
to learn more.

### Onchain Program Development

Onchain program development consists of either writing programs in Rust, C, or
C++. First you'll need to make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. You
can do this with the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You'll then need to have the [Solana CLI installed](/docs/intro/installation.md)
to compile and deploy your programs. You can install the Solana CLI by running
the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```

Using the Solana CLI, it is recommended to run a local validator for testing
your program. To run a local validator after installing the Solana CLI, run the
following command:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

This will start a local validator on your machine that you can use to test your
programs. You can
[read more about local development in this guide](/docs/intro/installation.md).

When building onchain programs, you have a choice to either build with native
Rust (ie, without a framework) or use the Anchor framework. Anchor is a
framework that makes it easier to build on Solana by providing a higher-level
API for developers. Think of Anchor like building with React for your websites
instead of raw Javascript and HTML. While Javascript and HTML give you more
control over your website, React accelerates your development and makes
developing easy. You can read more about [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)
on their website.

You'll need a way to test your program. There are a few different ways to test
your program based on your language preference:

- [solana-program-test](https://docs.rs/solana-program-test/latest/solana_program_test/) -
  Testing framework built in Rust
- [solana-bankrun](https://kevinheavey.github.io/solana-bankrun/) - Testing
  framework built for writing Typescript tests
- [bankrun](https://kevinheavey.github.io/solders/tutorials/bankrun.html) -
  Testing framework built for writing Python tests

If you do not want to develop your programs locally, there's also the
[online IDE Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io). Solana Playground allows
you to write, test, and deploy programs on Solana. You can get started with
Solana Playground by
[following our guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/hello-world-in-your-browser).

### Developer Environments

Choosing the right environment based on your work is very important. On Solana,
there are a few different network environments (called clusters) to facilitate
mature testing and CI/CD practices:

- **Mainnet Beta**: The production network where all the action happens.
  Transactions cost real money here.
- **Devnet**: The quality assurance network where you deploy your programs to
  test before deploying to production. Think "staging environment".
- **Local**: The local network that you run on your machine using
  `solana-test-validator` to test your programs. This should be your first
  choice when developing programs.

## Build by Example

While you get started building on Solana, there's a few more resources available
to help accelerate your journey:

- [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook): A collection of
  references and code snippets to help you build on Solana.
- [Solana Program Examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples):
  A repository of example programs providing building blocks for different
  actions on your programs.
- [Guides](https://solana.com/developers/guides): Tutorials and guides to walk
  you through building on Solana.

## Getting Support

The best support you can find is on
[Solana StackExchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com/). Search for your
question there first - there's a good chance there will already be a question
asked by someone else, with an answer. If it's not there, add a new question!
Remember to include as much detail as you can in your question, and please use
text (not screenshots) to show error messages, so other people with the same
problem can find your question!
