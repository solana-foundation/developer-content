## What is Solana?

Solana is an open source project implementing a new, high-performance,
permissionless blockchain. The Solana Foundation is based in Geneva, Switzerland
and maintains the open source project.

## Why Solana?

It is possible for a centralized database to process 710,000 transactions per
second on a standard gigabit network if the transactions are, on average, no
more than 176 bytes. A centralized database can also replicate itself and
maintain high availability without significantly compromising that transaction
rate using the distributed system technique known as Optimistic Concurrency
Control
[\[H.T.Kung, J.T.Robinson (1981)\]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.65.4735).
At Solana, we are demonstrating that these same theoretical limits apply just as
well to blockchain on an adversarial network. The key ingredient? Finding a way
to share time when nodes cannot rely upon one another. Once nodes can rely upon
time, suddenly ~40 years of distributed systems research becomes applicable to
blockchain!

Furthermore, and much to our surprise, it can be implemented using a mechanism
that has existed in Bitcoin since day one. The Bitcoin feature is called
`nLocktime` and it can be used to postdate transactions using block height
instead of a timestamp. As a Bitcoin client, you would use block height instead
of a timestamp if you don't rely upon the network. Block height turns out to be
an instance of what's being called a Verifiable Delay Function in cryptography
circles. It's a cryptographically secure way to say time has passed. In Solana,
we use a far more granular verifiable delay function, a SHA 256 hash chain, to
checkpoint the ledger and coordinate consensus. With it, we implement Optimistic
Concurrency Control and are now well en route towards that theoretical limit of
710,000 transactions per second.

## Documentation Overview

The Solana docs describe the Solana open source project, a blockchain built from
the ground up for scale. They cover why Solana is useful, how to use it, how it
works, and why it will continue to work long after the company Solana closes its
doors. The goal of the Solana architecture is to demonstrate there exists a set
of software algorithms that when used in combination to implement a blockchain,
removes software as a performance bottleneck, allowing transaction throughput to
scale proportionally with network bandwidth. The architecture goes on to satisfy
all three desirable properties of a proper blockchain: it is scalable, secure
and decentralized.

The architecture describes a theoretical upper bound of 710 thousand
transactions per second \(tps\) on a standard gigabit network and 28.4 million
tps on 40 gigabit. Furthermore, the architecture supports safe, concurrent
execution of programs authored in general-purpose programming languages such as
C or Rust.

## What is a Solana Cluster?

A cluster is a set of computers that work together and can be viewed from the
outside as a single system. A Solana cluster is a set of independently owned
computers working together \(and sometimes against each other\) to verify the
output of untrusted, user-submitted programs. A Solana cluster can be utilized
any time a user wants to preserve an immutable record of events in time or
programmatic interpretations of those events. One use is to track which of the
computers did meaningful work to keep the cluster running. Another use might be
to track the possession of real-world assets. In each case, the cluster produces
a record of events called the ledger. It will be preserved for the lifetime of
the cluster. As long as someone somewhere in the world maintains a copy of the
ledger, the output of its programs \(which may contain a record of who possesses
what\) will forever be reproducible, independent of the organization that
launched it.

## What are SOLs?

A SOL is the name of Solana's native token, which can be passed to nodes in a
Solana cluster in exchange for running an on-chain program or validating its
output. The system may perform micro-payments of fractional SOLs, which are
called _lamports_. They are named in honor of Solana's biggest technical
influence, [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport). A
lamport has a value of 0.000000001 SOL.
