description:
  "Deploying on-chain programs can be done using the Solana CLI using the
  Upgradable BPF loader to upload the compiled byte-code to the Solana
  blockchain."
---

Solana on-chain programs (otherwise known as "smart contracts") are stored in
"executable" accounts on Solana. These accounts are identical to any other
account but with the exception of:

- having the "executable" flag enabled, and
- the owner being assigned to a BPF loader

Besides those exceptions, they are governed by the same runtime rules as
non-executable accounts, hold SOL tokens for rent fees, and store a data buffer
which is managed by the BPF loader program. The latest BPF loader is called the
"Upgradeable BPF Loader".

## Overview of the Upgradeable BPF Loader

### State accounts

The Upgradeable BPF loader program supports three different types of state
accounts:

1. [Program account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/bpf_loader_upgradeable.rs#L34):
   This is the main account of an on-chain program and its address is commonly
   referred to as a "program id." Program id's are what transaction instructions
   reference in order to invoke a program. Program accounts are immutable once
   deployed, so you can think of them as a proxy account to the byte-code and
   state stored in other accounts.
2. [Program data account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/bpf_loader_upgradeable.rs#L39):
   This account is what stores the executable byte-code of an on-chain program.
   When a program is upgraded, this account's data is updated with new
   byte-code. In addition to byte-code, program data accounts are also
   responsible for storing the slot when it was last modified and the address of
   the sole account authorized to modify the account (this address can be
   cleared to make a program immutable).
3. [Buffer accounts](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/bpf_loader_upgradeable.rs#L27):
   These accounts temporarily store byte-code while a program is being actively
   deployed through a series of transactions. They also each store the address
   of the sole account which is authorized to do writes.

### Instructions

The state accounts listed above can only be modified with one of the following
instructions supported by the Upgradeable BPF Loader program:

1. [Initialize buffer](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L21):
   Creates a buffer account and stores an authority address which is allowed to
   modify the buffer.
2. [Write](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L28):
   Writes byte-code at a specified byte offset inside a buffer account. Writes
   are processed in small chunks due to a limitation of Solana transactions
   having a maximum serialized size of 1232 bytes.
3. [Deploy](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L77):
   Creates both a program account and a program data account. It fills the
   program data account by copying the byte-code stored in a buffer account. If
   the byte-code is valid, the program account will be set as executable,
   allowing it to be invoked. If the byte-code is invalid, the instruction will
   fail and all changes are reverted.
4. [Upgrade](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L102):
   Fills an existing program data account by copying executable byte-code from a
   buffer account. Similar to the deploy instruction, it will only succeed if
   the byte-code is valid.
5. [Set authority](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L114):
   Updates the authority of a program data or buffer account if the account's
   current authority has signed the transaction being processed. If the
   authority is deleted without replacement, it can never be set to a new
   address and the account can never be closed.
6. [Close](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/sdk/program/src/loader_upgradeable_instruction.rs#L127):
   Clears the data of a program data account or buffer account and reclaims the
   SOL used for the rent exemption deposit.

## How `solana program deploy` works

Deploying a program on Solana requires hundreds, if not thousands of
transactions, due to the max size limit of 1232 bytes for Solana transactions.
The Solana CLI takes care of this rapid firing of transactions with the
`solana program deploy` subcommand. The process can be broken down into the
following 3 phases:

1. [Buffer initialization](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/cli/src/program.rs#L2113):
   First, the CLI sends a transaction which
   [creates a buffer account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/cli/src/program.rs#L1903)
   large enough for the byte-code being deployed. It also invokes the
   [initialize buffer instruction](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L320)
   to set the buffer authority to restrict writes to the deployer's chosen
   address.
2. [Buffer writes](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/cli/src/program.rs#L2129):
   Once the buffer account is initialized, the CLI
   [breaks up the program byte-code](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/cli/src/program.rs#L1940)
   into ~1KB chunks and
   [sends transactions at a rate of 100 transactions per second](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/client/src/tpu_client.rs#L133)
   to write each chunk with
   [the write buffer instruction](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L334).
   These transactions are sent directly to the current leader's transaction
   processing (TPU) port and are processed in parallel with each other. Once all
   transactions have been sent, the CLI
   [polls the RPC API with batches of transaction signatures](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/client/src/tpu_client.rs#L216)
   to ensure that every write was successful and confirmed.
3. [Finalization](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/cli/src/program.rs#L1807):
   Once writes are completed, the CLI
   [sends a final transaction](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/cli/src/program.rs#L2150)
   to either
   [deploy a new program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L362)
   or
   [upgrade an existing program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/7409d9d2687fba21078a745842c25df805cdf105/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L513).
   In either case, the byte-code written to the buffer account will be copied
   into a program data account and verified.

<Callout type="info">

During times of congestion it is helpful to add priority fees and increase the
max sign attempts. Using a rpc url which has
[stake weighted quality of service](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/stake-weighted-qos)
enabled can also help to make program deploys more reliable. Using Solana
version ^1.18.15 is recommended.

Example command deploying a program with the Solana CLI:

```shell
program deploy target/deploy/your_program.so --with-compute-unit-price 10000 --max-sign-attempts 1000 --use-rpc
```

</Callout>

## Reclaim rent from program accounts

The storage of data on the Solana blockchain requires the payment of
[rent](/docs/intro/rent.md), including for the byte-code for on-chain programs.
Therefore as you deploy more or larger programs, the amount of rent paid to
remain rent-exempt will also become larger.

Using the current rent cost model configuration, a rent-exempt account requires
a deposit of ~0.7 SOL per 100KB stored. These costs can have an outsized impact
on developers who deploy their own programs since
[program accounts](/docs/core/accounts.md#custom-programs) are among the largest
we typically see on Solana.

#### Example of how much data is used for programs

As a data point of the number of accounts and potential data stored on-chain,
below is the distribution of the largest accounts (at least 100KB) at slot
`103,089,804` on `mainnet-beta` by assigned on-chain program:

1. **Serum Dex v3**: 1798 accounts
2. **Metaplex Candy Machine**: 1089 accounts
3. **Serum Dex v2**: 864 accounts
4. **Upgradeable BPF Program Loader**: 824 accounts
5. **BPF Program Loader v2**: 191 accounts
6. **BPF Program Loader v1**: 150 accounts

### Reclaiming buffer accounts

Buffer accounts are used by the Upgradeable BPF loader to temporarily store
byte-code that is in the process of being deployed on-chain. This temporary
buffer is required when upgrading programs because the currently deployed
program's byte-code cannot be affected by an in-progress upgrade.

Unfortunately, deploys fail occasionally and instead of reusing the buffer
account, developers might retry their deployment with a new buffer and not
realize that they stored a good chunk of SOL in a forgotten buffer account from
an earlier deploy.

> As of slot `103,089,804` on `mainnet-beta` there are 276 abandoned buffer
> accounts that could be reclaimed!

Developers can check if they own any abandoned buffer accounts by using the
Solana CLI:

```shell
solana program show --buffers --keypair ~/.config/solana/MY_KEYPAIR.json

Buffer Address                               | Authority                                    | Balance
9vXW2c3qo6DrLHa1Pkya4Mw2BWZSRYs9aoyoP3g85wCA | 2nr1bHFT86W9tGnyvmYW4vcHKsQB3sVQfnddasz4kExM | 3.41076888 SOL
```

And they can close those buffers to reclaim the SOL balance with the following
command:

```shell
solana program close --buffers --keypair ~/.config/solana/MY_KEYPAIR.json
```

#### Fetch the owners of buffer accounts via RPC API

The owners of all abandoned program deploy buffer accounts can be fetched via
the RPC API:

```shell
curl http://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-binary @- << EOF | jq --raw-output '.result | .[] | .account.data[0]'
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"getProgramAccounts",
    "params":[
        "BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111",
        {
            "dataSlice": {"offset": 5, "length": 32},
            "filters": [{"memcmp": {"offset": 0, "bytes": "2UzHM"}}],
            "encoding": "base64"
        }
    ]
}
EOF
```

After re-encoding the base64 encoded keys into base58 and grouping by key, we
see some accounts have over 10 buffer accounts they could close, yikes!

```shell
'BE3G2F5jKygsSNbPFKHHTxvKpuFXSumASeGweLcei6G3' => 10 buffer accounts
'EsQ179Q8ESroBnnmTDmWEV4rZLkRc3yck32PqMxypE5z' => 10 buffer accounts
'6KXtB89kAgzW7ApFzqhBg5tgnVinzP4NSXVqMAWnXcHs' => 12 buffer accounts
'FinVobfi4tbdMdfN9jhzUuDVqGXfcFnRGX57xHcTWLfW' => 15 buffer accounts
'TESAinbTL2eBLkWqyGA82y1RS6kArHvuYWfkL9dKkbs' => 42 buffer accounts
```

### Reclaiming program data accounts

You may now realize that program data accounts (the accounts that store the
executable byte-code for an on-chain program) can also be closed.

> **Note:** This does _not_ mean that _program accounts_ can be closed (those
> are immutable and can never be reclaimed, but it's fine they're pretty small).
> It's also important to keep in mind that once program data accounts are

While it would be uncommon for developers to need to close program data accounts
since they can be rewritten during upgrades, one potential scenario is that
since program data accounts can't be _resized_. You may wish to deploy your
program at a new address to accommodate larger executables.

The ability to reclaim program data account rent deposits also makes testing and
experimentation on the `mainnet-beta` cluster a lot less costly since you could
reclaim everything except the transaction fees and a small amount of rent for
the program account. Lastly, this could help developers recover most of their
funds if they mistakenly deploy a program at an unintended address or on the
wrong cluster.

To view the programs which are owned by your wallet address, you can run:

```shell
solana -V # must be 1.7.11 or higher!
solana program show --programs --keypair ~/.config/solana/MY_KEYPAIR.json

Program Id                                   | Slot      | Authority                                    | Balance
CN5x9WEusU6pNH66G22SnspVx4cogWLqMfmb85Z3GW7N | 53796672  | 2nr1bHFT86W9tGnyvmYW4vcHKsQB3sVQfnddasz4kExM | 0.54397272 SOL
```

To close those program data accounts and reclaim their SOL balance, you can run:

```shell
solana program close --programs --keypair ~/.config/solana/MY_KEYPAIR.json
```

You might be concerned about this feature allowing malicious actors to close a
program in a way that negatively impacts end users. While this is a valid
concern in general, closing program data accounts doesn't make this any more
exploitable than was already possible.

Even without the ability to close a program data account, any upgradeable
program could be upgraded to a no-op implementation and then have its upgrade
authority cleared to make it immutable forever. This new feature for closing
program data accounts merely adds the ability to reclaim the rent deposit,
disabling a program was already technically possible.
