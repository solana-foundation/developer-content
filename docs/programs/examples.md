The
"[Solana Program Examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples)"
repository on GitHub offers several subfolders, each containing code examples
for different Solana programming paradigms and languages, designed to help
developers learn and experiment with Solana blockchain development.

You can find the examples in the `solana-developers/program-examples` together
with README files that explain you how to run the different examples. Most
examples are self-contained and are available in native Rust (ie, with no
framework), [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation),
[Seahorse](https://seahorse-lang.org/) and it also contains a list of examples
that we would love to
[see as contributions](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#examples-wed-love-to-see).  
Within the repo you will find the following subfolder, each with assorted
example programs within them:

- [Basics](#basics)
- [Compression](#compression)
- [Oracles](#oracles)
- [Tokens](#tokens)
- [Token 2022 (Token Extensions)](#token-2022-token-extensions)
- [Break](#break)
  - [Build and Run](#build-and-run)

## Token 2022 (Token Extensions)

Token 2022 is a new standard for tokens on Solana. It is a more flexible and
lets you add 16 different extensions to a token mint to add more functionality
to it. A full list of the extensions can be found in the
[Getting Started Guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/getting-started)

## Break

[Break](https://break.solana.com/) is a React app that gives users a visceral
feeling for just how fast and high-performance the Solana network really is. Can
you _break_ the Solana blockchain? During a 15 second play-through, each click
of a button or keystroke sends a new transaction to the cluster. Smash the
keyboard as fast as you can and watch your transactions get finalized in
real-time while the network takes it all in stride!

Break can be played on our Devnet, Testnet and Mainnet Beta networks. Plays are
free on Devnet and Testnet, where the session is funded by a network faucet. On
Mainnet Beta, users pay to play 0.08 SOL per game. The session account can be
funded by a local keystore wallet or by scanning a QR code from Trust Wallet to
transfer the tokens.
