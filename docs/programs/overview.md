Developers can write and deploy their own programs to the Solana blockchain.
This process can be broadly summarized into a few key steps.

<Callout title="Hello World: Get started with Solana development">

To quickly get started with Solana development and build your first Rust
program, take a look at these detailed quick start guides:

- [Build and deploy your first Solana program using only your browser](/content/guides/getstarted/hello-world-in-your-browser.md).
  No installation needed.
- [Setup your local environment](/docs/intro/installation) and use the local
  test validator.

## On-chain program development lifecycle

1. Setup your development environment
2. Write your program
3. Compile the program
4. Generate the program's public address
5. Deploy the program

### 1. Setup your development environment

The most robust way of getting started with Solana development, is
[installing the Solana CLI](/docs/intro/installation.md) tools on your local
computer. This will allow you to have the most powerful development environment.

Some developers may also opt for using
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/), a browser based IDE. It will let
you write, build, and deploy onchain programs. All from your browser. No
installation needed.

### 2. Write your program

Writing Solana programs is most commonly done so using the Rust language. These
Rust programs are effectively the same as creating a traditional
[Rust library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates/lib.html).

> You can read more about other [supported languages](#support-languages) below.

### 3. Compile the program

Once the program is written, it must be complied down to
[Berkley Packet Filter](/docs/programs/faq.md#berkeley-packet-filter-bpf)
byte-code that will then be deployed to the blockchain.

### 4. Generate the program's public address

Using the [Solana CLI](/docs/intro/installation.md), the developer will generate
a new unique [Keypair](/docs/terminology.md#keypair) for the new program. The
public address (aka [Pubkey](/docs/terminology.md#public-key-pubkey)) from this
Keypair will be used on-chain as the program's public address (aka
[`programId`](/docs/terminology.md#program-id)).

### 5. Deploying the program

Then again using the CLI, the compiled program can be deployed to the selected
blockchain cluster by creating many transactions containing the program's
byte-code. Due to the transaction memory size limitations, each transaction
effectively sends small chunks of the program to the blockchain in a rapid-fire
manner.

Once the entire program has been sent to the blockchain, a final transaction is
sent to write all of the buffered byte-code to the program's data account. This
either mark the new program as `executable`, or complete the process to upgrade
an existing program (if it already existed).

## Support languages

Solana programs are typically written in the
[Rust language](/docs/programs/lang-rust.md), but
[C/C++](/docs/programs/lang-c.md) are also supported.

There are also various community driven efforts to enable writing on-chain
programs using other languages, including:

- Python via [Seahorse](https://seahorse.dev/) (that acts as a wrapper the Rust
  based Anchor framework)

## Example programs

You can also explore the [Program Examples](/docs/programs/examples.md) for
examples of onchain programs.

## Limitations

As you dive deeper into program development, it is important to understand some
of the important limitations associated with onchain programs.

Read more details on the [Limitations](/docs/programs/limitations.md) page
