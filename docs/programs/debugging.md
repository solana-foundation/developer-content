title: "Debugging Programs"
---

Solana programs run on-chain, so debugging them in the wild can be challenging.
To make debugging programs easier, developers can write unit tests that directly
test their program's execution via the Solana runtime, or run a local cluster
that will allow RPC clients to interact with their program.

## Running unit tests

- [Testing with Rust](/docs/programs/lang-rust.md#how-to-test)
- [Testing with C](/docs/programs/lang-c.md#how-to-test)

## Logging

During program execution both the runtime and the program log status and error
messages.

For information about how to log from a program see the language specific
documentation:

- [Logging from a Rust program](/docs/programs/lang-rust.md#logging)
- [Logging from a C program](/docs/programs/lang-c.md#logging)

When running a local cluster the logs are written to stdout as long as they are
enabled via the `RUST_LOG` log mask. From the perspective of program development
it is helpful to focus on just the runtime and program logs and not the rest of
the cluster logs. To focus in on program specific information the following log
mask is recommended:

```shell
export RUST_LOG=solana_runtime::system_instruction_processor=trace,solana_runtime::message_processor=info,solana_bpf_loader=debug,solana_rbpf=debug
```

Log messages coming directly from the program (not the runtime) will be
displayed in the form:

`Program log: <user defined message>`

## Error Handling

The amount of information that can be communicated via a transaction error is
limited but there are many points of possible failures. The following are
possible failure points and information about what errors to expect and where to
get more information:

- The SBF loader may fail to parse the program, this should not happen since the
  loader has already _finalized_ the program's account data.
  - `InstructionError::InvalidAccountData` will be returned as part of the
    transaction error.
- The SBF loader may fail to setup the program's execution environment
  - `InstructionError::Custom(0x0b9f_0001)` will be returned as part of the
    transaction error. "0x0b9f_0001" is the hexadecimal representation of
    [`VirtualMachineCreationFailed`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/bc7133d7526a041d1aaee807b80922baa89b6f90/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L44).
- The SBF loader may have detected a fatal error during program executions
  (things like panics, memory violations, system call errors, etc...)
  - `InstructionError::Custom(0x0b9f_0002)` will be returned as part of the
    transaction error. "0x0b9f_0002" is the hexadecimal representation of
    [`VirtualMachineFailedToRunProgram`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/bc7133d7526a041d1aaee807b80922baa89b6f90/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L46).
- The program itself may return an error
  - `InstructionError::Custom(<user defined value>)` will be returned. The "user
    defined value" must not conflict with any of the
    [builtin runtime program errors](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/bc7133d7526a041d1aaee807b80922baa89b6f90/sdk/program/src/program_error.rs#L87).
    Programs typically use enumeration types to define error codes starting at
    zero so they won't conflict.

In the case of `VirtualMachineFailedToRunProgram` errors, more information about
the specifics of what failed are written to the
[program's execution logs](/docs/programs/debugging.md#logging).

For example, an access violation involving the stack will look something like
this:

```text
SBF program 4uQeVj5tqViQh7yWWGStvkEG1Zmhx6uasJtWCJziofM failed: out of bounds memory store (insn #615), addr 0x200001e38/8
```

## Monitoring Compute Budget Consumption

The program can log the remaining number of compute units it will be allowed
before program execution is halted. Programs can use these logs to wrap
operations they wish to profile.

- [Log the remaining compute units from a Rust program](/docs/programs/lang-rust.md#compute-budget)
- [Log the remaining compute units from a C program](/docs/programs/lang-c.md#compute-budget)

See [compute budget](/docs/core/fees.md#compute-budget) for more information.

## ELF Dump

The SBF shared object internals can be dumped to a text file to gain more
insight into a program's composition and what it may be doing at runtime.

- [Create a dump file of a Rust program](/docs/programs/lang-rust.md#elf-dump)
- [Create a dump file of a C program](/docs/programs/lang-c.md#elf-dump)

## Instruction Tracing

During execution the runtime SBF interpreter can be configured to log a trace
message for each SBF instruction executed. This can be very helpful for things
like pin-pointing the runtime context leading up to a memory access violation.

The trace logs together with the [ELF dump](#elf-dump) can provide a lot of
insight (though the traces produce a lot of information).

To turn on SBF interpreter trace messages in a local cluster configure the
`solana_rbpf` level in `RUST_LOG` to `trace`. For example:

`export RUST_LOG=solana_rbpf=trace`

## Source level debugging

Source level debugging of on-chain programs written in Rust or C can be done
using the `program run` subcommand of `solana-ledger-tool`, and lldb,
distributed with Solana Rust and Clang compiler binary package platform-tools.

The `solana-ledger-tool program run` subcommand loads a compiled on-chain
program, executes it in RBPF virtual machine and runs a gdb server that accepts
incoming connections from LLDB or GDB. Once lldb is connected to
`solana-ledger-tool` gdbserver, it can control execution of an on-chain program.
Run `solana-ledger-tool program run --help` for an example of specifying input
data for parameters of the program entrypoint function.

To compile a program for debugging use cargo-build-sbf build utility with the
command line option `--debug`. The utility will generate two loadable files, one
a usual loadable module with the extension `.so`, and another the same loadable
module but containing Dwarf debug information, a file with extension `.debug`.

To execute a program in debugger, run `solana-ledger-tool program run` with
`-e debugger` command line option. For example, a crate named 'helloworld' is
compiled and an executable program is built in `target/deploy` directory. There
should be three files in that directory

- helloworld-keypair.json -- a keypair for deploying the program,
- helloworld.debug -- a binary file containing debug information,
- helloworld.so -- an executable file loadable into the virtual machine. The
  command line for running `solana-ledger-tool` would be something like this

```shell
solana-ledger-tool program run -l test-ledger -e debugger target/deploy/helloworld.so
```

Note that `solana-ledger-tool` always loads a ledger database. Most on-chain
programs interact with a ledger in some manner. Even if for debugging purpose a
ledger is not needed, it has to be provided to `solana-ledger-tool`. A minimal
ledger database can be created by running `solana-test-validator`, which creates
a ledger in `test-ledger` subdirectory.

In debugger mode `solana-ledger-tool program run` loads an `.so` file and starts
listening for an incoming connection from a debugger

```text
Waiting for a Debugger connection on "127.0.0.1:9001"...
```

To connect to `solana-ledger-tool` and execute the program, run lldb. For
debugging rust programs it may be beneficial to run solana-lldb wrapper to lldb,
i.e. at a new shell prompt (other than the one used to start
`solana-ledger-tool`) run the command:

```shell
solana-lldb
```

This script is installed in platform-tools path. If that path is not added to
`PATH` environment variable, it may be necessary to specify the full path, e.g.

```text
~/.cache/solana/v1.35/platform-tools/llvm/bin/solana-lldb
```

After starting the debugger, load the .debug file by entering the following
command at the debugger prompt

```text
(lldb) file target/deploy/helloworld.debug
```

If the debugger finds the file, it will print something like this

```text
Current executable set to '/path/helloworld.debug' (bpf).
```

Now, connect to the gdb server that `solana-ledger-tool` implements, and debug
the program as usual. Enter the following command at lldb prompt

```text
(lldb) gdb-remote 127.0.0.1:9001
```

If the debugger and the gdb server establish a connection, the execution of the
program will be stopped at the entrypoint function, and lldb should print
several lines of the source code around the entrypoint function signature. From
this point on, normal lldb commands can be used to control execution of the
program being debugged.

### Debugging in an IDE

To debug on-chain programs in Visual Studio IDE, install the CodeLLDB extension.
Open CodeLLDB Extension Settings. In Advanced settings change the value of
`Lldb: Library` field to the path of `liblldb.so` (or liblldb.dylib on macOS).
For example on Linux a possible path to Solana customized lldb can be
`/home/<user>/.cache/solana/v1.33/platform-tools/llvm/lib/liblldb.so.` where
`<user>` is your Linux system username. This can also be added directly to
`~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` file, e.g.

```json
{
  "lldb.library": "/home/<user>/.cache/solana/v1.35/platform-tools/llvm/lib/liblldb.so"
}
```

In `.vscode` subdirectory of your on-chain project, create two files

First file is `tasks.json` with the following content

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "build",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cargo build-sbf --debug",
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "solana-debugger",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "solana-ledger-tool program run -l test-ledger -e debugger ${workspaceFolder}/target/deploy/helloworld.so"
    }
  ]
}
```

The first task is to build the on-chain program using cargo-build-sbf utility.
The second task is to run `solana-ledger-tool program run` in debugger mode.

Another file is `launch.json` with the following content

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "lldb",
      "request": "custom",
      "name": "Debug",
      "targetCreateCommands": [
        "target create ${workspaceFolder}/target/deploy/helloworld.debug"
      ],
      "processCreateCommands": ["gdb-remote 127.0.0.1:9001"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This file specifies how to run debugger and to connect it to the gdb server
implemented by `solana-ledger-tool`.

To start debugging a program, first build it by running the build task. The next
step is to run `solana-debugger` task. The tasks specified in `tasks.json` file
are started from `Terminal >> Run Task...` menu of VSCode. When
`solana-ledger-tool` is running and listening from incoming connections, it's
time to start the debugger. Launch it from VSCode `Run and Debug` menu. If
everything is set up correctly, VSCode will start a debugging session and the
program execution should stop on the entrance into the `entrypoint` function.
