When developing programs on Solana, ensuring their correctness and reliability
is crucial. Until now devs have been using `solana-test-validator` for testing.
This document covers testing your Solana program with Node.js  
using `solana-bankrun`.

## Overview

There are two ways to test programs on Solana:

1. [solana-test-validator](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/examples/test-validator):
   That spins up a local emulator of the Solana Blockchain on your local machine
   which receives the transactions to be processed by the validator.
2. The various
   [BanksClient-based](https://docs.rs/solana-banks-client/latest/solana_banks_client/)
   test frameworks for SBF (Solana Bytecode Format) programs: Bankrun is a
   framework that simulates a Solana bank’s operations, enabling developers to
   deploy, interact with, and assess the behaviour of programs under test
   conditions that mimic the mainnet. It helps set up the test environment and
   offers tools for detailed transaction insights, enhancing debugging and
   verification. With the client, we can load programs, and simulate and process
   transactions seamlessly.
   [solana-program-test](https://docs.rs/solana-program-test) (Rust),
   [solana-bankrun](https://github.com/kevinheavey/solana-bankrun) (Rust,
   JavaScript), [anchor-bankrun](https://www.npmjs.com/package/anchor-bankrun)
   (Anchor, JavaScript),
   [solders.bankrun](https://kevinheavey.github.io/solders/api_reference/bankrun.html)
   (Python) are examples of the BanksClient-based testing framework.

   ```
   Note:
    > [`pnpm create solana-program`](https://github.com/solana-program/create-solana-program) can help you generate JS and Rust clients including tests.
    > Anchor is not yet supported.
   ```

In this guide, we are using Solana Bankrun. `Bankrun` is a superfast, powerful,
and lightweight framework for testing Solana programs in Node.js.

- The biggest advantage of using Solana Bankrun is that you don’t have to set
  up  
  an environment to test programs like you’d have to do while using the  
  `solana-test-validator`. Instead, you can do that with a piece of code,
  inside  
  the tests.
- It also dynamically sets time and account data, which isn’t possible with  
  `solana-test-validator`

## Installation

Add `solana-bankrun` as a dev dependency to your node project. If your Solana
program is not a node project yet, you can initialize it using `npm init`.

```bash
npm i -D solana-bankrun
```

## Usage

### Program Directory

Firstly, the program's `.so` file must be present in one of the following
directories:

- `./tests/fixtures` (just create this directory if it doesn't exist already).
- Your current working directory.
- A directory you define in the `BPF_OUT_DIR` or `SBF_OUT_DIR` environment
  variables. `export BPF_OUT_DIR=’/path/to/binary’`
- Build your program specifying the correct directory so that library can pick
  the file up from directory just from the name.
  `cargo build-sbf --manifest-path=./program/Cargo.toml --sbf-out-dir=./tests/fixtures`

### Testing Framework

solana-bankrun is used in JavaScript or TypeScript with testing frameworks like
[ts-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-mocha),
[ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),  
etc. Make sure to get started with any of the above.

Add an [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts) to test
your program and create your `test.ts` file inside `tests` folder.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "pnpm ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 ./tests/test.ts"
  }
}
```

### Start

`start` function from `solana-bankrun` spins up a BanksServer and a BanksClient,
deploy programs and add accounts as instructed.

```typescript
import { start } from "solana-bankrun";
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

test("testing program instruction", async () => {
  const programId = PublicKey.unique();
  const context = await start([{ name: "program_name", programId }], []);

  const client = context.banksClient;
  const payer = context.payer;
  // write tests
});
```

### Bankrun `context`

- We get access to the Bankrun `context` from the `start` function. Context
  contains a BanksClient, a recent blockhash and a funded payer keypair.
- `context` has a `payer`, which is a funded keypair that can be used to sign
  transactions.
- `context` also has `context.lastBlockhash` or `context.getLatestBlockhash` to
  make fetching [Blockhash](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#blockhash)
  convenient during tests.
- `context.banksClient` is used to send transactions and query account data from
  the ledger state. For example, sometimes
  [Rent](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#rent) (in lamports) is  
  required to build a transaction to be submitted, for example, when using the
  SystemProgram's  
  createAccount() instruction. You can do that using BanksClient:

  ```typescript
  const rent = await client.getRent();

  const Ix: TransactionInstruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
    // ...
    lamports: Number(rent.minimumBalance(BigInt(ACCOUNT_SIZE))),
    //....
  });
  ```

- You can read account data from BanksClient using `getAccount` function
  ```typescript
  AccountInfo = await client.getAccount(counter);
  ```

### Process Transaction

The `processTransaction()` function executes the transaction with the loaded
programs  
and accounts from the start function and will return a transaction.

```typescript
let transaction = await client.processTransaction(tx);
```

## Example

Here’s an example to write test for
a [hello world program](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples/tree/main/basics/hello-solana/native) :

```typescript
import {
  PublicKey,
  Transaction,
  TransactionInstruction,
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import { start } from "solana-bankrun";
import { describe, test } from "node:test";
import { assert } from "chai";

describe("hello-solana", async () => {
  // load program in solana-bankrun
  const PROGRAM_ID = PublicKey.unique();
  const context = await start(
    [{ name: "hello_solana_program", programId: PROGRAM_ID }],
    [],
  );
  const client = context.banksClient;
  const payer = context.payer;

  test("Say hello!", async () => {
    const blockhash = context.lastBlockhash;
    // We set up our instruction first.
    let ix = new TransactionInstruction({
      // using payer keypair from context to sign the txn
      keys: [{ pubkey: payer.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true }],
      programId: PROGRAM_ID,
      data: Buffer.alloc(0), // No data
    });

    const tx = new Transaction();
    tx.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
    // using payer keypair from context to sign the txn
    tx.add(ix).sign(payer);

    // Now we process the transaction
    let transaction = await client.processTransaction(tx);

    assert(transaction.logMessages[0].startsWith("Program " + PROGRAM_ID));
    assert(transaction.logMessages[1] === "Program log: Hello, Solana!");
    assert(
      transaction.logMessages[2] ===
        "Program log: Our program's Program ID: " + PROGRAM_ID,
    );
    assert(
      transaction.logMessages[3].startsWith(
        "Program " + PROGRAM_ID + " consumed",
      ),
    );
    assert(transaction.logMessages[4] === "Program " + PROGRAM_ID + " success");
    assert(transaction.logMessages.length == 5);
  });
});
```

This is how the output looks like after running the tests for
[hello world program](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples/tree/main/basics/hello-solana/native).
