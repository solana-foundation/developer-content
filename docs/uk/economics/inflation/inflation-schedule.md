As mentioned above, the network's _Inflation Schedule_ is uniquely described by
three parameters: _Initial Inflation Rate_, _Disinflation Rate_ and _Long-term
Inflation Rate_. When considering these numbers, there are many factors to take
into account:

- A large portion of the SOL issued via inflation will be distributed to
  stake-holders in proportion to the SOL they have staked. We want to ensure
  that the _Inflation Schedule_ design results in reasonable _Staking Yields_
  for token holders who delegate SOL and for validation service providers (via
  commissions taken from _Staking Yields_).
- The primary driver of _Staked Yield_ is the amount of SOL staked divided by
  the total amount of SOL (% of total SOL staked). Therefore the distribution
  and delegation of tokens across validators are important factors to understand
  when determining initial inflation parameters.
- Yield throttling is a current area of research that would impact
  _staking-yields_. This is not taken into consideration in the discussion here
  or the modeling below.
- Overall token issuance - i.e. what do we expect the Current Total Supply to be
  in 10 years, or 20 years?
- Long-term, steady-state inflation is an important consideration not only for
  sustainable support for the validator ecosystem and the Solana Foundation
  grant programs, but also should be tuned in consideration with expected token
  losses and burning over time.
- The rate at which we expect network usage to grow, as a consideration to the
  disinflationary rate. Over time, we plan for inflation to drop and expect that
  usage will grow.

Based on these considerations and the community discussions following the
initial design, the Solana Foundation proposes the following Inflation Schedule
parameters:

- Initial Inflation Rate: 8%
- Disinflation Rate: -15%
- Long-term Inflation Rate: 1.5%

These parameters define the proposed _Inflation Schedule_. Below we show
implications of these parameters. These plots only show the impact of inflation
issuances given the Inflation Schedule as parameterized above. They _do not
account_ for other factors that may impact the Total Supply such as fee/rent
burning, slashing or other unforeseen future token destruction events.
Therefore, what is presented here is an **upper limit** on the amount of SOL
issued via inflation.

In the above graph we see the annual inflation rate percentage over time, given
the inflation parameters proposed above.

Similarly, here we see the _Total Current Supply_ of SOL [MM] over time,
assuming an initial _Total Current Supply_ of `488,587,349 SOL` (i.e. for this
example, taking the _Total Current Supply_ as of `2020-01-25` and simulating
inflation starting from that day).

Setting aside validator uptime and commissions, the expected Staking Yield and
Adjusted Staking Yield metrics are then primarily a function of the % of total
SOL staked on the network. Therefore we can model _Staking Yield_, if we
introduce an additional parameter _% of Staked SOL_:

<!-- $$
\%~\text{SOL Staked} = \frac{\text{Total SOL Staked}}{\text{Total Current Supply}}
$$ -->

This parameter must be estimated because it is a dynamic property of the token
holders and staking incentives. The values of _% of Staked SOL_ presented here
range from 60% - 90%, which we feel covers the likely range we expect to
observe, based on feedback from the investor and validator communities as well
as what is observed on comparable Proof-of-Stake protocols.

Again, the above shows an example _Staked Yield_ that a staker might expect over
time on the Solana network with the _Inflation Schedule_ as specified. This is
an idealized _Staked Yield_ as it neglects validator uptime impact on rewards,
validator commissions, potential yield throttling and potential slashing
incidents. It additionally ignores that _% of Staked SOL_ is dynamic by design -
the economic incentives set up by this _Inflation Schedule_ are more clearly
seen when _Token Dilution_ is taken into account (see the **Adjusted Staking
Yield** section below).
