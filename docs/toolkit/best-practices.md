## Optimize Compute Usage

To prevent abuse of computational resources, each transaction is allocated a
"compute budget". This budget specifies details about
[compute units](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#compute-units) and includes:

- the compute costs associated with different types of operations the
  transaction may perform (compute units consumed per operation),
- the maximum number of compute units that a transaction can consume (compute
  unit limit),
- and the operational bounds the transaction must adhere to (like account data
  size limits)

When the transaction consumes its entire compute budget (compute budget
exhaustion), or exceeds a bound such as attempting to exceed the
[max call stack depth](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/b7bbe36918f23d98e2e73502e3c4cba78d395ba9/program-runtime/src/compute_budget.rs#L138)
or
[max loaded account](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#accounts-data-size-limit)
data size limit, the runtime halts the transaction processing and returns an
error. Resulting in a failed transaction and no state changes (aside from the
transaction fee being
[collected](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#fee-collection)).

## Saving Bumps

Saving the bump to your Solana smart contract account state enables
deterministic address generation, efficiency in address reconstruction, reduced
transaction failure, and consistency across invocations.

## Payer-Authority Pattern

The Payer-Authority pattern is an elegant way to handle situations where the
account’s funder (payer) differs from the account’s owner or manager
(authority). By requiring separate signers and validating them in your on-chain
logic, you can maintain clear, robust, and flexible ownership semantics in your
progra

### Shank Example

```rust
// Create a new account.
#[account(0, writable, signer, name="account", desc = "The address of the new account")]
#[account(1, writable, signer, name="payer", desc = "The account paying for the storage fees")]
#[account(2, optional, signer, name="authority", desc = "The authority signing for the account creation")]
#[account(3, name="system_program", desc = "The system program")]
CreateAccountV1(CreateAccountV1Args),
```

### Anchor Example

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateAccount<'info> {
    /// The address of the new account
    #[account(init, payer = payer_one, space = 8 + NewAccount::MAXIMUM_SIZE)]
    pub account: Account<'info, NewAccount>,

    /// The account paying for the storage fees
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,

    /// The authority signing for the account creation
    pub authority: Option<Signer<'info>>,

    // The system program
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>
}
```

## Invariants

Implement invariants, which are functions that you can call at the end of your
instruction to assert specific properties because they help ensure the
correctness and reliability of programs.

```rust
require!(amount > 0, ErrorCode::InvalidAmount);
```

## Optimize Indexing

You can make indexing easier by placing static size fields at the beginning and
variable size fields at the end of your on-chain structures.

## Noop/Self CPI

## Safe Math
