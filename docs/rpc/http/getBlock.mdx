<DocLeftSide>

### Parameters

<Parameter type={"u64"} required={true}>
  slot number, as <code>u64</code> integer
</Parameter>

<Parameter type={"object"} optional={true}>

Configuration object containing the following fields:

<Field
  name="commitment"
  type="string"
  optional={true}
  defaultValue={"finalized"}
  href="/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment"
>
  <li>
    the default is <code>finalized</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>processed</code> is not supported.
  </li>
</Field>

<Field 
  name="encoding"
  type="string"
  defaultValue="json"
  optional={true}
  href="/docs/rpc#parsed-responses"
>

encoding format for each returned Transaction

<Values values={["json", "jsonParsed", "base58", "base64"]} />

<details>

- `jsonParsed` attempts to use program-specific instruction parsers to return
  more human-readable and explicit data in the
  `transaction.message.instructions` list.
- If `jsonParsed` is requested but a parser cannot be found, the instruction
  falls back to regular JSON encoding (`accounts`, `data`, and `programIdIndex`
  fields).

</details>

</Field>

<Field name="transactionDetails" type="string" optional={true} defaultValue={"full"}>

level of transaction detail to return

<Values values={["full", "accounts", "signatures", "none"]} />

<details>

- If `accounts` are requested, transaction details only include signatures and
  an annotated list of accounts in each transaction.
- Transaction metadata is limited to only: fee, err, pre_balances,
  post_balances, pre_token_balances, and post_token_balances.

</details>

</Field>

<Field name="maxSupportedTransactionVersion" type="number" optional={true}>

the max transaction version to return in responses.

<details>

- If the requested block contains a transaction with a higher version, an error
  will be returned.
- If this parameter is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and a
  block containing any versioned transaction will prompt the error.

</details>

</Field>

<Field name="rewards" type="bool" optional={true}>
  whether to populate the `rewards` array. If parameter not provided, the
  default includes rewards.
</Field>

</Parameter>

#### Transaction Structure

Transactions are quite different from those on other blockchains. Be sure to
review [Anatomy of a Transaction](/docs/core/transactions) to learn about
transactions on Solana.

The JSON structure of a transaction is defined as follows:

- `signatures: <array[string]>` - A list of base-58 encoded signatures applied
  to the transaction. The list is always of length
  `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` and not empty. The signature at index
  `i` corresponds to the public key at index `i` in `message.accountKeys`. The
  first one is used as the [transaction id](/docs/terminology#transaction-id).
- `message: <object>` - Defines the content of the transaction.
  - `accountKeys: <array[string]>` - List of base-58 encoded public keys used by
    the transaction, including by the instructions and for signatures. The first
    `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` public keys must sign the
    transaction.
  - `header: <object>` - Details the account types and signatures required by
    the transaction.
    - `numRequiredSignatures: <number>` - The total number of signatures
      required to make the transaction valid. The signatures must match the
      first `numRequiredSignatures` of `message.accountKeys`.
    - `numReadonlySignedAccounts: <number>` - The last
      `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the signed keys are read-only accounts.
      Programs may process multiple transactions that load read-only accounts
      within a single PoH entry, but are not permitted to credit or debit
      lamports or modify account data. Transactions targeting the same
      read-write account are evaluated sequentially.
    - `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts: <number>` - The last
      `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts` of the unsigned keys are read-only accounts.
  - `recentBlockhash: <string>` - A base-58 encoded hash of a recent block in
    the ledger used to prevent transaction duplication and to give transactions
    lifetimes.
  - `instructions: <array[object]>` - List of program instructions that will be
    executed in sequence and committed in one atomic transaction if all succeed.
    - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array
      indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
    - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the
      `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the
      program.
    - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.
  - `addressTableLookups: <array[object]|undefined>` - List of address table
    lookups used by a transaction to dynamically load addresses from on-chain
    address lookup tables. Undefined if `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` is not
    set.
    - `accountKey: <string>` - base-58 encoded public key for an address lookup
      table account.
    - `writableIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load
      addresses of writable accounts from a lookup table.
    - `readonlyIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load
      addresses of readonly accounts from a lookup table.

#### Inner Instructions Structure

The Solana runtime records the cross-program instructions that are invoked
during transaction processing and makes these available for greater transparency
of what was executed on-chain per transaction instruction. Invoked instructions
are grouped by the originating transaction instruction and are listed in order
of processing.

The JSON structure of inner instructions is defined as a list of objects in the
following structure:

- `index: number` - Index of the transaction instruction from which the inner
  instruction(s) originated
- `instructions: <array[object]>` - Ordered list of inner program instructions
  that were invoked during a single transaction instruction.
  - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array
    indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
  - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the
    `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the
    program.
  - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.

#### Token Balances Structure

The JSON structure of token balances is defined as a list of objects in the
following structure:

- `accountIndex: <number>` - Index of the account in which the token balance is
  provided for.
- `mint: <string>` - Pubkey of the token's mint.
- `owner: <string|undefined>` - Pubkey of token balance's owner.
- `programId: <string|undefined>` - Pubkey of the Token program that owns the
  account.
- `uiTokenAmount: <object>` -
  - `amount: <string>` - Raw amount of tokens as a string, ignoring decimals.
  - `decimals: <number>` - Number of decimals configured for token's mint.
  - `uiAmount: <number|null>` - Token amount as a float, accounting for
    decimals. **DEPRECATED**
  - `uiAmountString: <string>` - Token amount as a string, accounting for
    decimals.
