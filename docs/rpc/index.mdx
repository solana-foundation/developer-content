Interact with Solana nodes directly with the JSON RPC API via the HTTP and
Websocket methods.

## Configuring State Commitment

For preflight checks and transaction processing, Solana nodes choose which bank
state to query based on a commitment requirement set by the client. The
commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When
querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to
report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back.

In descending order of commitment (most finalized to least finalized), clients
may specify:

- `finalized` - the node will query the most recent block confirmed by
  supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the
  cluster has recognized this block as finalized
- `confirmed` - the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on
  by supermajority of the cluster.
  - It incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
  - It does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that
    block.
  - This confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in
    release 1.3 and onwards.
- `processed` - the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block
  may still be skipped by the cluster.

For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use
`confirmed` commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total
safety, it's recommended to use `finalized` commitment.

### Default Commitment

If commitment configuration is not provided, the node will
[default to `finalized` commitment](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/aa0922d6845e119ba466f88497e8209d1c82febc/sdk/src/commitment_config.rs#L199-L203)

Only methods that query bank state accept the commitment parameter. They are
indicated in the API Reference below.

## RpcResponse Structure

Many methods that take a commitment parameter return an RpcResponse JSON object
comprised of two parts:

- `context` : An RpcResponseContext JSON structure including a `slot` field at
  which the operation was evaluated.
- `value` : The value returned by the operation itself.

## Parsed Responses

Some methods support an `encoding` parameter, and can return account or
instruction data in parsed JSON format if `"encoding":"jsonParsed"` is requested
and the node has a parser for the owning program. Solana nodes currently support
JSON parsing for the following native and SPL programs:

| Program                      | Account State | Instructions |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Address Lookup               | v1.15.0       | v1.15.0      |
| BPF Loader                   | n/a           | stable       |
| BPF Upgradeable Loader       | stable        | stable       |
| Config                       | stable        |              |
| SPL Associated Token Account | n/a           | stable       |
| SPL Memo                     | n/a           | stable       |
| SPL Token                    | stable        | stable       |
| SPL Token 2022               | stable        | stable       |
| Stake                        | stable        | stable       |
| Vote                         | stable        | stable       |

and instruction parsers

## Filter criteria

Some methods support providing a `filters` object to enable pre-filtering the
data returned within the RpcResponse JSON object. The following filters exist:

- `memcmp: object` - compares a provided series of bytes with program account
  data at a particular offset. Fields:

  - `offset: usize` - offset into program account data to start comparison
  - `bytes: string` - data to match, as encoded string
  - `encoding: string` - encoding for filter `bytes` data, either "base58" or
    "base64". Data is limited in size to 128 or fewer decoded bytes.<br />
    **NEW: This field, and base64 support generally, is only available in
    solana-core v1.14.0 or newer. Please omit when querying nodes on earlier
    versions**

- `dataSize: u64` - compares the program account data length with the provided
  data size
