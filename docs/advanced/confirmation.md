Problems relating to
[transaction confirmation](/docs/terminology.md#transaction-confirmations) are
common with many newer developers while building applications. This article aims
to boost the overall understanding of the confirmation mechanism used on the
Solana blockchain, including some recommended best practices.

## Brief background on transactions

Before diving into how Solana transaction confirmation and expiration works,
let's briefly set the base understanding of a few things:

- what a transaction is
- the lifecycle of a transaction
- what a blockhash is
- and a brief understanding of Proof of History (PoH) and how it relates to
  blockhashes

### What is a transaction?

Transactions consist of two components: a
[message](/docs/terminology.md#message) and a
[list of signatures](/docs/terminology.md#signature). The transaction message is
where the magic happens and at a high level it consists of four components:

- a **header** with metadata about the transaction,
- a **list of instructions** to invoke,
- a **list of accounts** to load, and
- a **“recent blockhash.”**

In this article, we're going to be focusing a lot on a transaction's
[recent blockhash](/docs/terminology.md#blockhash) because it plays a big role
in transaction confirmation.

### Transaction lifecycle refresher

Below is a high level view of the lifecycle of a transaction. This article will
touch on everything except steps 1 and 4.

1. Create a header and a list of instructions along with the list of accounts
   that instructions need to read and write
2. Fetch a recent blockhash and use it to prepare a transaction message
3. Simulate the transaction to ensure it behaves as expected
4. Prompt user to sign the prepared transaction message with their private key
5. Send the transaction to an RPC node which attempts to forward it to the
   current block producer
6. Hope that a block producer validates and commits the transaction into their
   produced block
7. Confirm the transaction has either been included in a block or detect when it
   has expired

### What is a Blockhash?

A [“blockhash”](/docs/terminology.md#blockhash) refers to the last Proof of
History (PoH) hash for a [“slot”](/docs/terminology.md#slot) (description
below). Since Solana uses PoH as a trusted clock, a transaction's recent
blockhash can be thought of as a **timestamp**.

### Proof of History refresher

Solana's Proof of History mechanism uses a very long chain of recursive SHA-256
hashes to build a trusted clock. The “history” part of the name comes from the
fact that block producers hash transaction id's into the stream to record which
transactions were processed in their block.

[PoH hash calculation](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/aa0922d6845e119ba466f88497e8209d1c82febc/entry/src/poh.rs#L79):
`next_hash = hash(prev_hash, hash(transaction_ids))`

PoH can be used as a trusted clock because each hash must be produced
sequentially. Each produced block contains a blockhash and a list of hash
checkpoints called “ticks” so that validators can verify the full chain of
hashes in parallel and prove that some amount of time has actually passed.

## Transaction Expiration

By default, all Solana transactions will expire if not committed to a block in a
certain amount of time. The **vast majority** of transaction confirmation issues
are related to how RPC nodes and validators detect and handle **expired**
transactions. A solid understanding of how transaction expiration works should
help you diagnose the bulk of your transaction confirmation issues.

### How does transaction expiration work?

Each transaction includes a “recent blockhash” which is used as a PoH clock
timestamp and expires when that blockhash is no longer “recent enough”.

As each block is finalized (i.e. the maximum tick height
[is reached](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/0588ecc6121ba026c65600d117066dbdfaf63444/runtime/src/bank.rs#L3269-L3271),
reaching the "block boundary"), the final hash of the block is added to the
`BlockhashQueue` which stores a maximum of the
[300 most recent blockhashes](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/e0b0bcc80380da34bb63364cc393801af1e1057f/sdk/program/src/clock.rs#L123-L126).
During transaction processing, Solana Validators will check if each
transaction's recent blockhash is recorded within the most recent 151 stored
hashes (aka "max processing age"). If the transaction's recent blockhash is
[older than this](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/cb2fd2b632f16a43eff0c27af7458e4e97512e31/runtime/src/bank.rs#L3570-L3571)
max processing age, the transaction is not processed.

> [max processing age of 150](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/cb2fd2b632f16a43eff0c27af7458e4e97512e31/sdk/program/src/clock.rs#L129-L131)

> there are actually 151 blockhashes that are considered "recent enough" and
> valid for processing.

Since [slots](/docs/terminology.md#slot) (aka the time period a validator can
produce a block) are configured to last about
[400ms](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/cb2fd2b632f16a43eff0c27af7458e4e97512e31/sdk/program/src/clock.rs#L107-L109),
but may fluctuate between 400ms and 600ms, a given blockhash can only be used by
transactions for about 60 to 90 seconds before it will be considered expired by
the runtime.

### Example of transaction expiration

Let's walk through a quick example:

1. A validator is actively producing a new block for the current slot
2. The validator receives a transaction from a user with the recent blockhash
   `abcd...`
3. The validator checks this blockhash `abcd...` against the list of recent
   blockhashes in the `BlockhashQueue` and discovers that it was created 151
   blocks ago
4. Since it is exactly 151 blockhashes old, the transaction has not expired yet
   and can still be processed!
5. But wait: before actually processing the transaction, the validator finished
   creating the next block and added it to the `BlockhashQueue`. The validator
   then starts producing the block for the next slot (validators get to produce
   blocks for 4 consecutive slots)
6. The validator checks that same transaction again and finds it is now 152
   blockhashes old and rejects it because it's too old :(

## Why do transactions expire?

There's a very good reason for this actually, it's to help validators avoid
processing the same transaction twice.

A naive brute force approach to prevent double processing could be to check
every new transaction against the blockchain's entire transaction history. But
by having transactions expire after a short amount of time, validators only need
to check if a new transaction is in a relatively small set of _recently_
processed transactions.

### Other blockchains

Solana's approach to prevent double processing is quite different from other
blockchains. For example, Ethereum tracks a counter (nonce) for each transaction
sender and will only process transactions that use the next valid nonce.

Ethereum's approach is simple for validators to implement, but it can be
problematic for users. Many people have encountered situations when their
Ethereum transactions got stuck in a _pending_ state for a long time and all the
later transactions, which used higher nonce values, were blocked from
processing.

### Advantages on Solana

There are a few advantages to Solana's approach:

1. A single fee payer can submit multiple transactions at the same time that are
   allowed to be processed in any order. This might happen if you're using
   multiple applications at the same time.
2. If a transaction doesn't get committed to a block and expires, users can try
   again knowing that their previous transaction will NOT ever be processed.

By not using counters, the Solana wallet experience may be easier for users to
understand because they can get to success, failure, or expiration states
quickly and avoid annoying pending states.

### Disadvantages on Solana

Of course there are some disadvantages too:

1. Validators have to actively track a set of all processed transaction id's to
   prevent double processing.
2. If the expiration time period is too short, users might not be able to submit
   their transaction before it expires.

These disadvantages highlight a tradeoff in how transaction expiration is
configured. If the expiration time of a transaction is increased, validators
need to use more memory to track more transactions. If expiration time is
decreased, users don't have enough time to submit their transaction.

Currently, Solana clusters require that transactions use blockhashes that are no
more than 151 blocks old.

> future if necessary without decreasing expiration time as are detailed in that
> issue.

## Transaction confirmation tips

As mentioned before, blockhashes expire after a time period of only 151 blocks
which can pass as quickly as **one minute** when slots are processed within the
target time of 400ms.

One minute is not a lot of time considering that a client needs to fetch a
recent blockhash, wait for the user to sign, and finally hope that the
broadcasted transaction reaches a leader that is willing to accept it. Let's go
through some tips to help avoid confirmation failures due to transaction
expiration!

### Fetch blockhashes with the appropriate commitment level

Given the short expiration time frame, it's imperative that clients and
applications help users create transactions with a blockhash that is as recent
as possible.

When fetching blockhashes, the current recommended RPC API is called
[`getLatestBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/getLatestBlockhash.mdx). By default, this
API uses the `finalized` commitment level to return the most recently finalized
block's blockhash. However, you can override this behavior by
[setting the `commitment` parameter](/docs/rpc/index.mdx#configuring-state-commitment)
to a different commitment level.

**Recommendation**

The `confirmed` commitment level should almost always be used for RPC requests
because it's usually only a few slots behind the `processed` commitment and has
a very low chance of belonging to a dropped
[fork](https://docs.solanalabs.com/consensus/fork-generation).

But feel free to consider the other options:

- Choosing `processed` will let you fetch the most recent blockhash compared to
  other commitment levels and therefore gives you the most time to prepare and
  process a transaction. But due to the prevalence of forking in the Solana
  blockchain, roughly 5% of blocks don't end up being finalized by the cluster
  so there's a real chance that your transaction uses a blockhash that belongs
  to a dropped fork. Transactions that use blockhashes for abandoned blocks
  won't ever be considered recent by any blocks that are in the finalized
  blockchain.
- Using the [default commitment](/docs/rpc#default-commitment) level `finalized`
  will eliminate any risk that the blockhash you choose will belong to a dropped
  fork. The tradeoff is that there is typically at least a 32 slot difference
  between the most recent confirmed block and the most recent finalized block.
  This tradeoff is pretty severe and effectively reduces the expiration of your
  transactions by about 13 seconds but this could be even more during unstable
  cluster conditions.

### Use an appropriate preflight commitment level

If your transaction uses a blockhash that was fetched from one RPC node then you
send, or simulate, that transaction with a different RPC node, you could run
into issues due to one node lagging behind the other.

When RPC nodes receive a `sendTransaction` request, they will attempt to
determine the expiration block of your transaction using the most recent
finalized block or with the block selected by the `preflightCommitment`
parameter. A **VERY** common issue is that a received transaction's blockhash
was produced after the block used to calculate the expiration for that
transaction. If an RPC node can't determine when your transaction expires, it
will only forward your transaction **one time** and afterwards will then
**drop** the transaction.

Similarly, when RPC nodes receive a `simulateTransaction` request, they will
simulate your transaction using the most recent finalized block or with the
block selected by the `preflightCommitment` parameter. If the block chosen for
simulation is older than the block used for your transaction's blockhash, the
simulation will fail with the dreaded “blockhash not found” error.

**Recommendation**

Even if you use `skipPreflight`, **ALWAYS** set the `preflightCommitment`
parameter to the same commitment level used to fetch your transaction's
blockhash for both `sendTransaction` and `simulateTransaction` requests.

### Be wary of lagging RPC nodes when sending transactions

When your application uses an RPC pool service or when the RPC endpoint differs
between creating a transaction and sending a transaction, you need to be wary of
situations where one RPC node is lagging behind the other. For example, if you
fetch a transaction blockhash from one RPC node then you send that transaction
to a second RPC node for forwarding or simulation, the second RPC node might be
lagging behind the first.

**Recommendation**

For `sendTransaction` requests, clients should keep resending a transaction to a
RPC node on a frequent interval so that if an RPC node is slightly lagging
behind the cluster, it will eventually catch up and detect your transaction's
expiration properly.

For `simulateTransaction` requests, clients should use the
[`replaceRecentBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/simulateTransaction.mdx) parameter to
tell the RPC node to replace the simulated transaction's blockhash with a
blockhash that will always be valid for simulation.

### Avoid reusing stale blockhashes

Even if your application has fetched a very recent blockhash, be sure that
you're not reusing that blockhash in transactions for too long. The ideal
scenario is that a recent blockhash is fetched right before a user signs their
transaction.

**Recommendation for applications**

Poll for new recent blockhashes on a frequent basis to ensure that whenever a
user triggers an action that creates a transaction, your application already has
a fresh blockhash that's ready to go.

**Recommendation for wallets**

Poll for new recent blockhashes on a frequent basis and replace a transaction's
recent blockhash right before they sign the transaction to ensure the blockhash
is as fresh as possible.

### Use healthy RPC nodes when fetching blockhashes

By fetching the latest blockhash with the `confirmed` commitment level from an
RPC node, it's going to respond with the blockhash for the latest confirmed
block that it's aware of. Solana's block propagation protocol prioritizes
sending blocks to staked nodes so RPC nodes naturally lag about a block behind
the rest of the cluster. They also have to do more work to handle application
requests and can lag a lot more under heavy user traffic.

Lagging RPC nodes can therefore respond to
[`getLatestBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/getLatestBlockhash.mdx) requests with
blockhashes that were confirmed by the cluster quite awhile ago. By default, a
lagging RPC node detects that it is more than 150 slots behind the cluster will
stop responding to requests, but just before hitting that threshold they can
still return a blockhash that is just about to expire.

**Recommendation**

Monitor the health of your RPC nodes to ensure that they have an up-to-date view
of the cluster state with one of the following methods:

1. Fetch your RPC node's highest processed slot by using the
   [`getSlot`](/docs/rpc/http/getSlot.mdx) RPC API with the `processed`
   commitment level and then call the
   [`getMaxShredInsertSlot`](/docs/rpc/http/getMaxShredInsertSlot.mdx) RPC API
   to get the highest slot that your RPC node has received a “shred” of a block
   for. If the difference between these responses is very large, the cluster is
   producing blocks far ahead of what the RPC node has processed.
2. Call the `getLatestBlockhash` RPC API with the `confirmed` commitment level
   on a few different RPC API nodes and use the blockhash from the node that
   returns the highest slot for its
   [context slot](/docs/rpc/index.mdx#rpcresponse-structure).

### Wait long enough for expiration

**Recommendation**

When calling the [`getLatestBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/getLatestBlockhash.mdx)
RPC API to get a recent blockhash for your transaction, take note of the
`lastValidBlockHeight` in the response.

Then, poll the [`getBlockHeight`](/docs/rpc/http/getBlockHeight.mdx) RPC API
with the `confirmed` commitment level until it returns a block height greater
than the previously returned last valid block height.

### Consider using “durable” transactions

Sometimes transaction expiration issues are really hard to avoid (e.g. offline
signing, cluster instability). If the previous tips are still not sufficient for
your use-case, you can switch to using durable transactions (they just require a
bit of setup).

To start using durable transactions, a user first needs to submit a transaction
that
[invokes instructions that create a special on-chain “nonce” account](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/system_instruction/fn.create_nonce_account.html)
and stores a “durable blockhash” inside of it. At any point in the future (as
long as the nonce account hasn't been used yet), the user can create a durable
transaction by following these 2 rules:

1. The instruction list must start with an
   [“advance nonce” system instruction](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/system_instruction/fn.advance_nonce_account.html)
   which loads their on-chain nonce account
2. The transaction's blockhash must be equal to the durable blockhash stored by
   the on-chain nonce account

Here's how these durable transactions are processed by the Solana runtime:

1. If the transaction's blockhash is no longer “recent”, the runtime checks if
   the transaction's instruction list begins with an “advance nonce” system
   instruction
2. If so, it then loads the nonce account specified by the “advance nonce”
   instruction
3. Then it checks that the stored durable blockhash matches the transaction's
   blockhash
4. Lastly it makes sure to advance the nonce account's stored blockhash to the
   latest recent blockhash to ensure that the same transaction can never be
   processed again

For more details about how these durable transactions work, you can read the
[original proposal](https://docs.solanalabs.com/implemented-proposals/durable-tx-nonces)
and
[check out an example](/content/guides/advanced/introduction-to-durable-nonces.md)
