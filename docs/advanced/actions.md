[Solana Actions](#actions) are specification-compliant APIs that return
transactions on the Solana blockchain to be previewed, signed, and sent across a
number of various contexts, including QR codes, buttons + widgets, and websites
across the internet. Actions make it simple for developers to integrate the
things you can do throughout the Solana ecosystem right into your environment,
allowing you to perform blockchain transactions without needing to navigate away
to a different app or webpage.

[Blockchain links](#blinks) – or blinks – turn any Solana Action into a
shareable, metadata-rich link. Blinks allow Action-aware clients (browser
extension wallets, bots) to display additional capabilities for the user. On a
website, a blink might immediately trigger a transaction preview in a wallet
without going to a decentralized app; in Discord, a bot might expand the blink
into an interactive set of buttons. This pushes the ability to interact on-chain
to any web surface capable of displaying a URL.

## Actions

The Solana Actions specification uses a set of standard APIs to deliver signable
transactions (and eventually signable messages) from an application directly to
a user. They are hosted at publicly accessible URLs and are therefore accessible
by their URL for any client to interact with.

> You can think of Actions as a API endpoint that will return metadata and
> something for a user to sign (either a transaction or a authentication
> message) with their blockchain wallet.

The Actions API consists of making simple `GET` and `POST` requests to an
Action's URL endpoint and handling the responses that conform to the Actions
interface.

1. the [GET request](#get-request) returns metadata that provides human-readable
   information to the client about what actions are available at this URL, and
   an optional list of related actions.
2. the [POST request](#post-request) returns a signable transaction or message
   that the client then prompts the user's wallet to sign and execute on the
   blockchain or in another off-chain service.

### Action Execution and Lifecycle

In practice, interacting with Actions closely resembles interacting with a
typical REST API:

- a client makes the initial `GET` request to an Action URL in order to fetch
  metadata about the Actions available
- the endpoint returns a response that include metadata about the endpoint (like
  the application's title and icon) and a listing of the available actions for
  this endpoint
- the client application (like a mobile wallet, chat bot, or website) displays a
  UI for the user to perform one of the actions
- after the user selects an action (by clicking a button), the client makes a
  `POST` request to the endpoint in order to get the transaction for the user to
  sign
- the wallet facilitates the user signing the transaction and ultimately sends
  the transaction to the blockchain for confirmation

![Solana Actions Execution and Lifecycle](/public/assets/docs/action-execution-and-lifecycle.png)

When receiving transactions from an Actions URL, clients should handle
submission of these transactions to the blockchain and manage their state
lifecycle.

Actions also support some level of invalidation before execution. The `GET` and
`POST` request may return some metadata that states whether the action is
capable of be taken (like with the `disabled` field).

For example, if there was an Action endpoint that facilitates voting on a DAO
governance proposal whose voting window has closed, the initial
[GET request](#get-request) may return the error message "This proposal is no
longer up for a vote" and the "Vote Yes" and "Vote No" buttons as "disabled".

## Blinks

Blinks (blockchain links) are client applications that introspect Action APIs
and construct user interfaces around interacting with and executing Actions.

Client applications that support blinks simply detect Action-compatible URLs,
parse them, and allow users to interact with them in standardized user
interfaces.

> Any client application that fully introspects an Actions API to build a
> complete interface for it is a _blink_. Therefore, not all clients that
> consume Actions APIs are blinks.

### Blink URL Specification

A blink URL describes a client application that enables a user to complete the
full [lifecycle of executing an Action](#action-execution-and-lifecycle),
including signing with their wallet.

```text
https://example.domain/?action=<action_url>
```

For any client application to become a blink:

- The blink URL must contain a query parameter of `action` whose value is a
  URL-encoded [Action URL](#url-scheme). This value must be
  [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)
  to not conflict with any other protocol parameters.

- The client application must
  [URL-decode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent)
  the `action` query parameter and introspect the Action API link provided (see
  [Action URL scheme](#url-scheme)).

- The client must render a rich user interface that enables a user to complete
  the full [lifecycle of executing an Action](#action-execution-and-lifecycle),
  including signing with their wallet.

> Not all blink client applications (e.g. websites or dApps) will support all
> Actions. Application developers may chose which Actions they want to support
> within their blink interfaces.

The following example demonstrates a valid blink URL with an `action` value of
`solana-action:https://actions.alice.com/donate` that is URL encoded:

```text
https://example.domain/?action=solana-action%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Factions.alice.com%2Fdonate
```

### Detecting Actions via Blinks

Blinks may be linked to Actions in at least 3 ways:

1. Sharing an explicit Action URL:
   `solana-action:https://actions.alice.com/donate`

   In this case, only supported clients may render the blink. There will be no
   fallback link preview, or site that may be visited outside of the
   non-supporting client.

2. Sharing a link to a website that is linked to an Actions API via an
   [`actions.json` file](#actionsjson) on the website's domain root.

   For example, `https://alice.com/actions.json` maps
   `https://alice.com/donate`, a website URL at which users can donate to Alice,
   to API URL `https://actions.alice.com/donate`, at which Actions for donating
   to Alice are hosted.

3. Embedding an Action URL in an “interstitial” site URL that understands how to
   parse Actions.

   ```text
   https://example.domain/?action=<action_url>
   ```

Clients that support blinks should be able to take any of the above formats and
correctly render an interface to facilitate executing the action directly in the
client.

For clients that do not support blinks, there should be an underlying website
(making the browser become the universal fallback).

If a user taps anywhere on a client that is not an action button or text input
field, they should be taken to the underlying site.

### Blink Testing and Verification

While Solana Actions and blinks are a permissionless protocol/specification,
client applications and wallets are still required to ultimately facilitate
users to sign the transaction.

Each of these client applications or wallets may have different requirements on
which Action endpoints their clients will automatically unfurl and immediately
display to their users on social media platforms.

For example, some clients may operate on an "allow list" approach that may
require verification prior to their client unfurling an Action for users such as
Dialect's Actions Registry (detailed below).

All blinks will still render and allow for signing on Dialect's
[dial.to](https://dial.to) blinks Interstitial site, with their registry status
displayed in the blink.

### Dialect's Actions Registry

As a public good for the Solana ecosystem, [Dialect](https://dialect.to)
maintains a public registry — together with the help of Solana Foundation and
other community members — of blockchain links that have are from pre-verified
from known sources. As of launch, only Actions that have been registered in the
Dialect registry will unfurl in the Twitter feed when posted.

Client applications and wallets can freely choose to use this public registry or
another solution to help ensure user security and safety. If not verified
through the Dialect registry, the blockchain link will not be touched by the
blink client, and will be rendered as a typical URL.

Developers can apply to be verified by Dialect here:
[dial.to/register](https://dial.to/register)

## Specification

The Solana Actions specification consists of key sections that are part of a
request/response interaction flow:

- Solana Action [URL scheme](#url-scheme) providing an Action URL
- [OPTIONS response](#options-response) to an Action URL to pass CORS
  requirements
- [GET request](#get-request) to an Action URL
- [GET response](#get-response) from the server
- [POST request](#post-request) to an Action URL
- [POST response](#post-response) from the server

Each of these requests are made by the _Action client_ (e.g. wallet app, browser
extension, dApp, website, etc) to gather specific metadata for rich user
interfaces and to facilitate user input to the Actions API.

Each of the responses are crafted by an application (e.g. website, server
backend, etc) and returned to the _Action client_. Ultimately, providing a
signable transaction or message for a wallet to prompt the user to approve,
sign, and send to the blockchain.

### URL Scheme

A Solana Action URL describes an interactive request for a signable Solana
transaction or message using the `solana-action` protocol.

The request is interactive because the parameters in the URL are used by a
client to make a series of standardized HTTP requests to compose a signable
transaction or message for the user to sign with their wallet.

```text
solana-action:<link>
```

- A single `link` field is required as the pathname. The value must be a
  conditionally
  [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)
  absolute HTTPS URL.

- If the URL contains query parameters, it must be URL-encoded. URL-encoding the
  value prevents conflicting with any Actions protocol parameters, which may be
  added via the protocol specification.

- If the URL does not contain query parameters, it should not be URL-encoded.
  This produces a shorter URL and a less dense QR code.

In either case, clients must
[URL-decode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent)
the value. This has no effect if the value isn't URL-encoded. If the decoded
value is not an absolute HTTPS URL, the wallet must reject it as **malformed**.

### OPTIONS response

In order to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)) within Actions
clients (including blinks), all Action endpoints should respond to HTTP requests
for the `OPTIONS` method with valid headers that will allow clients to pass CORS
checks for all subsequent requests from their same origin domain.

An Actions client may perform
"[preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests)"
requests to the Action URL endpoint in order check if the subsequent GET request
to the Action URL will pass all CORS checks. These CORS preflight checks are
made using the `OPTIONS` HTTP method and should respond with all required HTTP
headers that will allow Action clients (like blinks) to properly make all
subsequent requests from their origin domain.

At a minimum, the required HTTP headers include:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with a value of `*`
  - this ensures all Action clients can safely pass CORS checks in order to make
    all required requests
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` with a value of `GET,POST,PUT,OPTIONS`
  - ensures all required HTTP request methods are supported for Actions
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` with a minimum value of
  `Content-Type, Authorization, Content-Encoding, Accept-Encoding`

For simplicity, developers should consider returning the same response and
headers to `OPTIONS` requests as their [`GET` response](#get-response).

### GET Request

The Action client (e.g. wallet, browser extension, etc) should make an HTTP
`GET` JSON request to the Action's URL endpoint.

- The request should not identify the wallet or the user.
- The client should make the request with an
  [`Accept-Encoding` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding).
- The client should display the domain of the URL as the request is being made.

### GET Response

The Action's URL endpoint (e.g. application or server backend) should respond
with an HTTP `OK` JSON response (with a valid payload in the body) or an
appropriate HTTP error.

- The client must handle HTTP
  [client errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses),
  [server errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses),
  and
  [redirect responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages).
- The endpoint should respond with a
  [`Content-Encoding` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding)
  for HTTP compression.
- The endpoint should respond with a
  [`Content-Type` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)
  of `application/json`.

- The client should not cache the response except as instructed by
  [HTTP caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#controlling_caching)
  response headers.
- The client should display the `title` and render the `icon` image to user.

#### GET Response Body

A `GET` response with an HTTP `OK` JSON response should include a body payload
that follows the interface specification:

```ts filename="ActionGetResponse"
export interface ActionGetResponse {
  /** image url that represents the source of the action request */
  icon: string;
  /** describes the source of the action request */
  title: string;
  /** brief summary of the action to be performed */
  description: string;
  /** button text rendered to the user */
  label: string;
  /** UI state for the button being rendered to the user */
  disabled?: boolean;
  links?: {
    /** list of related Actions a user could perform */
    actions: LinkedAction[];
  };
  /** non-fatal error message to be displayed to the user */
  error?: ActionError;
}
```

- `icon` - The value must be an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL of an icon image. The
  file must be an SVG, PNG, or WebP image, or the client/wallet must reject it
  as **malformed**.

- `title` - The value must be a UTF-8 string that represents the source of the
  action request. For example, this might be the name of a brand, store,
  application, or person making the request.

- `description` - The value must be a UTF-8 string that provides information on
  the action. The description should be displayed to the user.

- `label` - The value must be a UTF-8 string that will be rendered on a button
  for the user to click. All labels should not exceed 5 word phrases and should
  start with a verb to solidify the action you want the user to take. For
  example, "Mint NFT", "Vote Yes", or "Stake 1 SOL".

- `disabled` - The value must be boolean to represent the disabled state of the
  rendered button (which displays the `label` string). If no value is provided,
  `disabled` should default to `false` (i.e. enabled by default). For example,
  if the action endpoint is for a governance vote that has closed, set
  `disabled=true` and the `label` could be "Vote Closed".

- `error` - An optional error indication for non-fatal errors. If present, the
  client should display it to the user. If set, it should not prevent the client
  from interpreting the action or displaying it to the user. For example, the
  error can be used together with `disabled` to display a reason like business
  constraints, authorization, the state, or an error of external resource.

```ts filename="ActionError"
export interface ActionError {
  /** non-fatal error message to be displayed to the user */
  message: string;
}
```

- `links.actions` - An optional array of related actions for the endpoint. Users
  should be displayed UI for each of the listed actions and expected to only
  perform one. For example, a governance vote action endpoint may return three
  options for the user: "Vote Yes", "Vote No", and "Abstain from Vote".

  - If no `links.actions` is provided, the client should render a single button
    using the root `label` string and make the POST request to the same action
    URL endpoint as the initial GET request.

  - If any `links.actions` are provided, the client should only render buttons
    and input fields based on the items listed in the `links.actions` field. The
    client should not render a button for the contents of the root `label`.

```ts filename="LinkedAction"
export interface LinkedAction {
  /** URL endpoint for an action */
  href: string;
  /** button text rendered to the user */
  label: string;
  /** Parameter to accept user input within an action */
  parameters?: [ActionParameter];
}

/** Parameter to accept user input within an action */
export interface ActionParameter {
  /** parameter name in url */
  name: string;
  /** placeholder text for the user input field */
  label?: string;
  /** declare if this field is required (defaults to `false`) */
  required?: boolean;
}
```

#### Example GET Response

The following example response provides a single "root" action that is expected
to be presented to the user a single button with a label of "Claim Access
Token":

```json
{
  "title": "HackerHouse Events",
  "icon": "<url-to-image>",
  "description": "Claim your Hackerhouse access token.",
  "label": "Claim Access Token" // button text
}
```

The following example response provides 3 related action links that allow the
user to click one of 3 buttons to cast their vote for a DAO proposal:

```json
{
  "title": "Realms DAO Platform",
  "icon": "<url-to-image>",
  "description": "Vote on DAO governance proposals #1234.",
  "label": "Vote",
  "links": {
    "actions": [
      {
        "label": "Vote Yes", // button text
        "href": "/api/proposal/1234/vote?choice=yes"
      },
      {
        "label": "Vote No", // button text
        "href": "/api/proposal/1234/vote?choice=no"
      },
      {
        "label": "Abstain from Vote", // button text
        "href": "/api/proposal/1234/vote?choice=abstain"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example GET Response with Parameters

The following examples response demonstrate how to accept text input from the
user (via `parameters`) and include that input in the final `POST` request
endpoint (via the `href` field within a `LinkedAction`):

The following example response provides the user with 3 linked actions to stake
SOL: a button labeled "Stake 1 SOL", another button labeled "Stake 5 SOL", and a
text input field that allows the user to enter a specific "amount" value that
will be sent to the Action API:

```json
{
  "title": "Stake-o-matic",
  "icon": "<url-to-image>",
  "description": "Stake SOL to help secure the Solana network.",
  "label": "Stake SOL", // not displayed since `links.actions` are provided
  "links": {
    "actions": [
      {
        "label": "Stake 1 SOL", // button text
        "href": "/api/stake?amount=1"
        // no `parameters` therefore not a text input field
      },
      {
        "label": "Stake 5 SOL", // button text
        "href": "/api/stake?amount=5"
        // no `parameters` therefore not a text input field
      },
      {
        "label": "Stake", // button text
        "href": "/api/stake?amount={amount}",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "amount", // field name
            "label": "SOL amount" // text input placeholder
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following example response provides a single input field for the user to
enter an `amount` which is sent with the POST request (either as a query
parameter or a subpath can be used):

```json
{
  "icon": "<url-to-image>",
  "label": "Donate SOL",
  "title": "Donate to GoodCause Charity",
  "description": "Help support this charity by donating SOL.",
  "links": {
    "actions": [
      {
        "label": "Donate", // button text
        "href": "/api/donate/{amount}", // or /api/donate?amount={amount}
        "parameters": [
          // {amount} input field
          {
            "name": "amount", // input field name
            "label": "SOL amount" // text input placeholder
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### POST Request

The client must make an HTTP `POST` JSON request to the action URL with a body
payload of:

```json
{
  "account": "<account>"
}
```

- `account` - The value must be the base58-encoded public key of an account that
  may sign the transaction.

The client should make the request with an
[Accept-Encoding header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding)
and the application may respond with a
[Content-Encoding header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding)
for HTTP compression.

The client should display the domain of the action URL as the request is being
made. If a `GET` request was made, the client should also display the `title`
and render the `icon` image from that GET response.

### POST Response

The Action's `POST` endpoint should respond with an HTTP `OK` JSON response
(with a valid payload in the body) or an appropriate HTTP error.

- The client must handle HTTP
  [client errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses),
  [server errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses),
  and
  [redirect responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages).
- The endpoint should respond with a
  [`Content-Type` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)
  of `application/json`.

#### POST Response Body

A `POST` response with an HTTP `OK` JSON response should include a body payload
of:

```ts filename="ActionPostResponse"
export interface ActionPostResponse {
  /** base64 encoded serialized transaction */
  transaction: string;
  /** describes the nature of the transaction */
  message?: string;
}
```

- `transaction` - The value must be a base64-encoded
  [serialized transaction](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#serialize).
  The client must base64-decode the transaction and
  [deserialize it](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#from).

- `message` - The value must be a UTF-8 string that describes the nature of the
  transaction included in the response. The client should display this value to
  the user. For example, this might be the name of an item being purchased, a
  discount applied to a purchase, or a thank you note.

- The client and application should allow additional fields in the request body
  and response body, which may be added by future specification updates.

> The application may respond with a partially or fully signed transaction. The
> client and wallet must validate the transaction as **untrusted**.

#### POST Response - Transaction

If the transaction
[`signatures`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#signatures)
are empty or the transaction has NOT been partially signed:

- The client must ignore the
  [`feePayer`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#feePayer)
  in the transaction and set the `feePayer` to the `account` in the request.
- The client must ignore the
  [`recentBlockhash`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#recentBlockhash)
  in the transaction and set the `recentBlockhash` to the
  [latest blockhash](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getLatestBlockhash).
- The client must serialize and deserialize the transaction before signing it.
  This ensures consistent ordering of the account keys, as a workaround for
  [this issue](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21722).

If the transaction has been partially signed:

- The client must NOT alter the
  [`feePayer`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#feePayer)
  or
  [`recentBlockhash`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Transaction.html#recentBlockhash)
  as this would invalidate any existing signatures.
- The client must verify existing signatures, and if any are invalid, the client
  must reject the transaction as **malformed**.

The client must only sign the transaction with the `account` in the request, and
must do so only if a signature for the `account` in the request is expected.

If any signature except a signature for the `account` in the request is
expected, the client must reject the transaction as **malicious**.

## actions.json

The purpose of the [`actions.json` file](#actionsjson) allows an application to
instruct clients on what website URLs support Solana Actions and provide a
mapping that can be used to perform [GET requests](#get-request) to an Actions
API server.

The `actions.json` file should be stored and universally accessible at the root
of the domain.

For example, if your web application is deployed to `my-site.com` then the
`actions.json` file should be accessible at `https://my-site.com/actions.json`.

### Rules

The `rules` field allows the application to map a set of a website's relative
route paths to a set of other paths.

**Type:** `Array` of `ActionRuleObject`.

```ts filename="ActionRuleObject"
interface ActionRuleObject {
  /** relative (preferred) or absolute path to perform the rule mapping from */
  pathPattern: string;
  /** relative (preferred) or absolute path that supports Action requests */
  apiPath: string;
}
```

- [`pathPattern`](#rules-pathpattern) - A pattern that matches each incoming
  pathname.

- [`apiPath`](#rules-apipath) - A location destination defined as an absolute
  pathname or external URL.

#### Rules - pathPattern

A pattern that matches each incoming pathname. It can be an absolute or relative
path and supports the following formats:

- **Exact Match**: Matches the exact URL path.

  - Example: `/exact-path`
  - Example: `https://website.com/exact-path`

- **Wildcard Match**: Uses wildcards to match any sequence of characters in the
  URL path. This can match single (using `*`) or multiple segments (using `**`).
  (see [Path Matching](#rules-path-matching) below).

  - Example: `/trade/*` will match `/trade/123` and `/trade/abc`, capturing only
    the first segment after `/trade/`.
  - Example: `/category/*/item/**` will match `/category/123/item/456` and
    `/category/abc/item/def`.
  - Example: `/api/actions/trade/*/confirm` will match
    `/api/actions/trade/123/confirm`.

#### Rules - apiPath

The destination path for the action request. It can be defined as an absolute
pathname or an external URL.

- Example: `/api/exact-path`
- Example: `https://api.example.com/v1/donate/*`
- Example: `/api/category/*/item/*`
- Example: `/api/swap/**`

#### Rules - Query Parameters

Query parameters from the original URL are always preserved and appended to the
mapped URL.

#### Rules - Path Matching

The following table outlines the syntax for path matching patterns:

| Operator | Matches                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Rules Examples

The following example demonstrates an exact match rule to map requests requests
to `/buy` from your site's root to the exact path `/api/buy` relative to your
site's root:

```json filename="actions.json"
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "pathPattern": "/buy",
      "apiPath": "/api/buy"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example uses wildcard path matching to map requests to any path
(excluding subdirectories) under `/actions/` from your site's root to a
corresponding path under `/api/actions/` relative to your site's root:

```json filename="actions.json"
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "pathPattern": "/actions/*",
      "apiPath": "/api/actions/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example uses wildcard path matching to map requests to any path
(excluding subdirectories) under `/donate/` from your site's root to a
corresponding absolute path `https://api.dialect.com/api/v1/donate/` on an
external site:

```json filename="actions.json"
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "pathPattern": "/donate/*",
      "apiPath": "https://api.dialect.com/api/v1/donate/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example uses wildcard path matching for an idempotent rule to map
requests to any path (including subdirectories) under `/api/actions/` from your
site's root to itself:

> Idempotent rules allow blink clients to more easily determine if a given path
> supports Action API requests without having to be prefixed with the
> `solana-action:` URI or performing additional response testing.

```json filename="actions.json"
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "pathPattern": "/api/actions/**",
      "apiPath": "/api/actions/**"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Action Identity

Action endpoints may include an _Action Identity_ in the transactions that are
returned in their [POST response](#post-response) for the user to sign. This
allows indexers and analytics platforms to easily and verifiably attribute
on-chain activity to a specific Action Provider (i.e. service) in a verifiable
way.

The [Action Identity](#action-identity) is a keypair used to sign a specially
formatted message that is included in transaction using a Memo instruction. This
_Identifier Message_ can be verifiably attributed to a specific Action Identity,
and therefore attribute transactions to a specific Action Provider.

The keypair is not required to sign the transaction itself. This allows wallets
and applications to improve transaction deliverability when no other signatures
are on the transaction returned to a user (see
[POST response transaction](#post-response-transaction)).

If an Action Provider's use case requires their backend services to pre-sign the
transaction before the user does, they should use this keypair as their Action
Identity. This will allow one less account be included in the transaction,
lowering the total transactions size by 32-bytes.

### Action Identifier Message

The Action Identifier Message is a colon separate UTF-8 string included in a
transaction using a single [SPL Memo](https://spl.solana.com/memo) instruction.

```shell
protocol:identity:reference:signature
```

- `protocol` - The value of the protocol being used (set to `solana-action` per
  the [URL Scheme](#url-scheme) above)
- `identity` - The value must be the base58-encoded public key address of the
  Action Identity keypair
- `reference` - The value must be base58-encoded 32-byte array. This may or may
  not be public keys, on or off the curve, and may or may not correspond with
  accounts on Solana.
- `signature` - base58-encoded signature created from the Action Identity
  keypair signing only the `reference` value.

The `reference` value must be used only once and in a single transaction. For
the purpose of associating transactions with an Action Provider, only the first
usage of the `reference` value is considered valid.

Transactions may have multiple Memo instructions. When performing a
[`getSignaturesForAddress`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getsignaturesforaddress),
the results `memo` field will return each memo instruction's message as a single
string with each separated by a semi-colon.

No other data should be included with Identifier Message's Memo instruction.

The `identity` and the `reference` should be included as read-only, non-signer
[keys](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/TransactionInstruction.html#keys)
in the transaction on an instruction that is NOT the Identifier Message Memo
instruction.

The Identifier Message Memo instruction must have zero accounts provided. If any
accounts are provided, the Memo program requires theses accounts to be valid
signers. For the purposes of identifying actions, this restricts flexibility and
can degrade the user experience. Therefore it is considered an anti-pattern and
must be avoided.

### Action Identity Verification

Any transaction that includes the `identity` account can be verifiably
associated with the Action Provider in a multi-step process:

1. Get all the transactions for a given `identity`.
2. Parse and verify each transaction's memo string, ensuring the `signature` is
   valid for the `reference` stored.
3. Verify the specific transaction is the first on-chain occurrence of the
   `reference` on-chain:
   - If this transaction is the first occurrence, the transaction is considered
     verified and can a safely attributed to the Action Provider.
   - If this transaction is NOT the first occurrence, it is considered invalid
     and therefore not attributed to the Action Provider.

Because Solana validators index transactions by the account keys, the
[`getSignaturesForAddress`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getsignaturesforaddress)
RPC method can be used locate all transactions including the `identity` account.

This RPC method's response includes all the Memo data in the `memo` field. If
multiple Memo instructions were used in the transaction, each memo message will
be included in this `memo` field and must be parsed accordingly by the verifier
to obtain the _Identity Verification Message_.

These transactions should be initially considered **UNVERIFIED**. This is due to
the `identity` not being required to sign the transaction which allows any
transaction to include this account as a non-signer. Potentially artificially
inflating attribution and usage counts.

The Identity Verification Message should be checked to ensure the `signature`
was created by the `identity` signing the `reference`. If this signature
verification fails, the transaction is invalid and should be attributed to the
Action Provider.

If the signature verification is successful, the verifier should ensure this
transaction is the first on-chain occurrence of the `reference`. If it is not,
the transaction is considered invalid.
