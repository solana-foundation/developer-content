title: Inflation Related Terminology

Many terms are thrown around when discussing inflation and the related
components (e.g. rewards/yield/interest), we try to define and clarify some
commonly used concept here:

### Total Current Supply [SOL]

The total amount of tokens (locked or unlocked) that have been generated (via
genesis block or protocol inflation) minus any tokens that have been burnt (via
transaction fees or other mechanism) or slashed. At network launch, 500,000,000
SOL were instantiated in the genesis block. Since then the Total Current Supply
has been reduced by the burning of transaction fees and a planned token
reduction event. Solana's _Total Current Supply_ can be found at
https://explorer.solana.com/supply

### Inflation Rate [%]

The Solana protocol will automatically create new tokens on a predetermined
inflation schedule (discussed below). The _Inflation Rate [%]_ is the annualized
growth rate of the _Total Current Supply_ at any point in time.

### Inflation Schedule

A deterministic description of token issuance over time. The Solana Foundation
is proposing a disinflationary _Inflation Schedule_. I.e. Inflation starts at
its highest value, the rate reduces over time until stabilizing at a
predetermined long-term inflation rate (see discussion below). This schedule is
completely and uniquely parameterized by three numbers:

- **Initial Inflation Rate [%]**: The starting _Inflation Rate_ for when
  inflation is first enabled. Token issuance rate can only decrease from this
  point.
- **Disinflation Rate [%]**: The rate at which the _Inflation Rate_ is reduced.
- **Long-term Inflation Rate [%]**: The stable, long-term _Inflation Rate_ to be
  expected.

### Effective Inflation Rate [%]

The inflation rate actually observed on the Solana network after accounting for
other factors that might decrease the _Total Current Supply_. Note that it is
not possible for tokens to be created outside of what is described by the
_Inflation Schedule_.

- While the _Inflation Schedule_ determines how the protocol issues SOL, this
  neglects the concurrent elimination of tokens in the ecosystem due to various
  factors. The primary token burning mechanism is the burning of a portion of
  each transaction fee. 50% of each transaction fee is burned, with the
  remaining fee retained by the validator that processes the transaction.
- Additional factors such as loss of private keys and slashing events should
  also be considered in a holistic analysis of the _Effective Inflation Rate_.
  For example, it's estimated that 10-20% of all BTC have been lost and are
  unrecoverable and that networks may experience similar yearly losses at the
  rate of 1-2%.

### Staking Yield [%]

The rate of return (aka _interest_) earned on SOL staked on the network. It is
often quoted as an annualized rate (e.g. "the network _staking yield_ is
currently 10% per year").

- _Staking yield_ is of great interest to validators and token holders who wish
  to delegate their tokens to avoid token dilution due to inflation (the extent
  of which is discussed below).
- 100% of inflationary issuances are to be distributed to staked token-holders
  in proportion to their staked SOL and to validators who charge a commission on
  the rewards earned by their delegated SOL.
  - There may be future consideration for an additional split of inflation
    issuance with the introduction of _Archivers_ into the economy. _Archivers_
    are network participants who provide a decentralized storage service and
    should also be incentivized with token distribution from inflation issuances
    for this service. - Similarly, early designs specified a fixed percentage of
    inflationary issuance to be delivered to the Foundation treasury for
    operational expenses and future grants. However, inflation will be launching
    without any portion allocated to the Foundation.
- _Staking yield_ can be calculated from the _Inflation Schedule_ along with the
  fraction of the _Total Current Supply_ that is staked at any given time. The
  explicit relationship is given by:

<!-- $$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Staking Yield} =~&\text{Inflation Rate}\times\text{Validator Uptime}~\times \\
&\left( 1 - \text{Validator Fee} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{\%~\text{SOL Staked}} \right) \\
\text{where:}\\
\%~\text{SOL Staked} &= \frac{\text{Total SOL Staked}}{\text{Total Current Supply}}
\end{aligned}
$$ -->

### Token Dilution [%]

Dilution is defined here as the change in proportional representation of a set
of tokens within a larger set due to the introduction of new tokens. In
practical terms, we discuss the dilution of staked or un-staked tokens due to
the introduction and distribution of inflation issuance across the network. As
will be shown below, while dilution impacts every token holder, the _relative_
dilution between staked and un-staked tokens should be the primary concern to
un-staked token holders. Staking tokens, which will receive their proportional
distribution of inflation issuance, should assuage any dilution concerns for
staked token holders. I.e. dilution from 'inflation' is offset by the
distribution of new tokens to staked token holders, nullifying the 'dilutive'
effects of the inflation for that group.

### Adjusted Staking Yield [%]

A complete appraisal of earning potential from staking tokens should take into
account staked _Token Dilution_ and its impact on the _Staking Yield_. For this,
we define the _Adjusted Staking Yield_ as the change in fractional token supply
ownership of staked tokens due to the distribution of inflation issuance. I.e.
the positive dilutive effects of inflation.
