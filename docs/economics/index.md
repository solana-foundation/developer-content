**Subject to change.**

Solana's crypto-economic system is designed to promote a healthy, long term
self-sustaining economy with participant incentives aligned to the security and
decentralization of the network. The main participants in this economy are
validation-clients. Their contributions to the network, state validation, and
their requisite incentive mechanisms are discussed below.

The main channels of participant remittances are referred to as protocol-based
rewards and transaction fees. Protocol-based rewards are generated from
inflationary issuances from a protocol-defined inflation schedule. These rewards
will constitute the total protocol-based reward delivered to validation clients,
the remaining sourced from transaction fees. In the early days of the network,
it is likely that protocol-based rewards, deployed based on predefined issuance
schedule, will drive the majority of participant incentives to participate in
the network.

These protocol-based rewards are calculated per epoch and distributed across the
active delegated stake and validator set (per validator commission). As
discussed further below, the per annum inflation rate is based on a
pre-determined disinflationary schedule. This provides the network with supply
predictability which supports long term economic stability and security.

Transaction fees are participant-to-participant transfers, attached to network
interactions as a motivation and compensation for the inclusion and execution of
a proposed transaction. A mechanism for long-term economic stability and forking
protection through partial burning of each transaction fee is also discussed
below.

First, an overview of the inflation design is presented. This section starts
with defining and clarifying
[Terminology](/docs/economics/inflation/terminology.md) commonly used
subsequently in the discussion of inflation and the related components.
Following that, we outline Solana's proposed
[Inflation Schedule](/docs/economics/inflation/inflation_schedule.md), i.e. the
specific parameters that uniquely parameterize the protocol-driven inflationary
issuance over time. Next is a brief section on
[Adjusted Staking Yield](/docs/economics/inflation/_adjusted_staking_yield.md),
and how token dilution might influence staking behavior.

An overview of [Transaction Fees](/docs/core/fees.md#transaction-fees) on Solana
is followed by a discussion of [Storage Rent Economics](/docs/core/fees.md#rent)
in which we describe an implementation of storage rent to account for the
externality costs of maintaining the active state of the ledger.
