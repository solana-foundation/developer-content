\*The public RPC endpoints are not intended for production applications. Please
use dedicated/private RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs,
etc. The public services are subject to abuse and rate limits may change without
prior notice. Likewise, high-traffic websites may be blocked without prior
notice.

## Common HTTP Error Codes

- 403 -- Your IP address or website has been blocked. It is time to run your own
  RPC server(s) or find a private service.
- 429 -- Your IP address is exceeding the rate limits. Slow down! Use the
  [Retry-After](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After)
  HTTP response header to determine how long to wait before making another
  request.
