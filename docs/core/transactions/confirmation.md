title: "Transaction Confirmation"
---

Problems relating to
[transaction confirmation](/docs/terminology#transaction-confirmations) are
common with many newer developers while building applications. This article aims
to boost the overall understanding of the confirmation mechanism used on the
Solana blockchain, including some recommended best practices.

## Brief background on transactions

Let’s first make sure we’re all on the same page and thinking about the same
things...

### What is a transaction?

Transactions consist of two components: a [message](/docs/terminology#message)
and a [list of signatures](/docs/terminology#signature). The transaction message
is where the magic happens and at a high level it consists of three components:

- a **list of instructions** to invoke,
- a **list of accounts** to load, and
- a **“recent blockhash.”**

In this article, we’re going to be focusing a lot on a transaction’s
[recent blockhash](/docs/terminology#blockhash) because it plays a big role in
transaction confirmation.

### Transaction lifecycle refresher

Below is a high level view of the lifecycle of a transaction. This article will
touch on everything except steps 1 and 4.

1. Create a list of instructions along with the list of accounts that
   instructions need to read and write
2. Fetch a recent blockhash and use it to prepare a transaction message
3. Simulate the transaction to ensure it behaves as expected
4. Prompt user to sign the prepared transaction message with their private key
5. Send the transaction to an RPC node which attempts to forward it to the
   current block producer
6. Hope that a block producer validates and commits the transaction into their
   produced block
7. Confirm the transaction has either been included in a block or detect when it
   has expired

## What is a Blockhash?

A [“blockhash”](/docs/terminology#blockhash) refers to the last Proof of History
(PoH) hash for a [“slot”](/docs/terminology#slot) (description below). Since
Solana uses PoH as a trusted clock, a transaction’s recent blockhash can be
thought of as a **timestamp**.

### Proof of History refresher

Solana’s Proof of History mechanism uses a very long chain of recursive SHA-256
hashes to build a trusted clock. The “history” part of the name comes from the
fact that block producers hash transaction id’s into the stream to record which
transactions were processed in their block.

[PoH hash calculation](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/9488a73f5252ad0d7ea830a0b456d9aa4bfbb7c1/entry/src/poh.rs#L82):
`next_hash = hash(prev_hash, hash(transaction_ids))`

PoH can be used as a trusted clock because each hash must be produced
sequentially. Each produced block contains a blockhash and a list of hash
checkpoints called “ticks” so that validators can verify the full chain of
hashes in parallel and prove that some amount of time has actually passed. The
stream of hashes can be broken up into the following time units:

# Transaction Expiration

By default, all Solana transactions will expire if not committed to a block in a
certain amount of time. The **vast majority** of transaction confirmation issues
are related to how RPC nodes and validators detect and handle **expired**
transactions. A solid understanding of how transaction expiration works should
help you diagnose the bulk of your transaction confirmation issues.

## How does transaction expiration work?

Each transaction includes a “recent blockhash” which is used as a PoH clock
timestamp and expires when that blockhash is no longer “recent” enough. More
concretely, Solana validators look up the corresponding slot number for each
transaction’s blockhash that they wish to process in a block. If the validator
[can’t find a slot number for the blockhash](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/9488a73f5252ad0d7ea830a0b456d9aa4bfbb7c1/runtime/src/bank.rs#L3687)
or if the looked up slot number is more than 151 slots lower than the slot
number of the block being processed, the transaction will be rejected.

Slots are configured to last about
[400ms](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/47b938e617b77eb3fc171f19aae62222503098d7/sdk/program/src/clock.rs#L12)
but often fluctuate between 400ms and 600ms, so a given blockhash can only be
used by transactions for about 60 to 90 seconds.

Transaction has expired pseudocode:
`currentBankSlot > slotForTxRecentBlockhash + 151`

Transaction not expired pseudocode:
`currentBankSlot - slotForTxRecentBlockhash < 152`

### Example of transaction expiration

Let’s walk through a quick example:

1. A validator is producing a new block for slot #1000
2. The validator receives a transaction with recent blockhash `1234...` from a
   user
3. The validator checks the `1234...` blockhash against the list of recent
   blockhashes leading up to its new block and discovers that it was the
   blockhash for slot #849
4. Since slot #849 is exactly 151 slots lower than slot #1000, the transaction
   hasn’t expired yet and can still be processed!
5. But wait, before actually processing the transaction, the validator finished
   the block for slot #1000 and starts producing the block for slot #1001
   (validators get to produce blocks for 4 consecutive slots).
6. The validator checks the same transaction again and finds that it’s now too
   old and drops it because it’s now 152 slots lower than the current slot :(

## Why do transactions expire?

There’s a very good reason for this actually, it’s to help validators avoid
processing the same transaction twice.

A naive brute force approach to prevent double processing could be to check
every new transaction against the blockchain’s entire transaction history. But
by having transactions expire after a short amount of time, validators only need
to check if a new transaction is in a relatively small set of _recently_
processed transactions.

### Other blockchains

Solana’s approach of prevent double processing is quite different from other
blockchains. For example, Ethereum tracks a counter (nonce) for each transaction
sender and will only process transactions that use the next valid nonce.

Ethereum’s approach is simple for validators to implement, but it can be
problematic for users. Many people have encountered situations when their
Ethereum transactions got stuck in a _pending_ state for a long time and all the
later transactions, which used higher nonce values, were blocked from
processing.

### Advantages on Solana

There are a few advantages to Solana’s approach:

1. A single fee payer can submit multiple transactions at the same time that are
   allowed to be processed in any order. This might happen if you’re using
   multiple applications at the same time.
2. If a transaction doesn’t get committed to a block and expires, users can try
   again knowing that their previous transaction won’t ever be processed.

By not using counters, the Solana wallet experience may be easier for users to
understand because they can get to success, failure, or expiration states
quickly and avoid annoying pending states.

### Disadvantages on Solana

Of course there are some disadvantages too:

1. Validators have to actively track a set of all processed transaction id’s to
   prevent double processing.
2. If the expiration time period is too short, users might not be able to submit
   their transaction before it expires.

These disadvantages highlight a tradeoff in how transaction expiration is
configured. If the expiration time of a transaction is increased, validators
need to use more memory to track more transactions. If expiration time is
decreased, users don’t have enough time to submit their transaction.

Currently, Solana clusters require that transactions use blockhashes that are no
more than
[151 slots](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/9488a73f5252ad0d7ea830a0b456d9aa4bfbb7c1/sdk/program/src/clock.rs#L65)
old.

## Transaction confirmation tips

As mentioned before, blockhashes expire after a time period of only 151 slots
which can pass as quickly as **one minute** when slots are processed within the
target time of 400ms.

One minute is not a lot of time considering that a client needs to fetch a
recent blockhash, wait for the user to sign, and finally hope that the
broadcasted transaction reaches a leader that is willing to accept it. Let’s go
through some tips to help avoid confirmation failures due to transaction
expiration!

### Fetch blockhashes with the appropriate commitment level

Given the short expiration time frame, it’s imperative that clients help users
create transactions with blockhash that is as recent as possible.

When fetching blockhashes, the current recommended RPC API is called
[`getLatestBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/getlatestblockhash). By default, this API
uses the `"finalized"` commitment level to return the most recently finalized
block’s blockhash. However, you can override this behavior by
[setting the `commitment` parameter](/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment) to
a different commitment level.

**Recommendation**

The `"confirmed"` commitment level should almost always be used for RPC requests
because it’s usually only a few slots behind the `"processed"` commitment and
has a very low chance of belonging to a dropped
[fork](./../cluster/fork-generation.md).

But feel free to consider the other options:

- Choosing `"processed"` will let you fetch the most recent blockhash compared
  to other commitment levels and therefore gives you the most time to prepare
  and process a transaction. But due to the prevalence of forking in the Solana
  protocol, roughly 5% of blocks don’t end up being finalized by the cluster so
  there’s a real chance that your transaction uses a blockhash that belongs to a
  dropped fork. Transactions that use blockhashes for abandoned blocks won’t
  ever be considered recent by any blocks that are in the finalized blockchain.
- Using the default commitment level `"finalized"` will eliminate any risk that
  the blockhash you choose will belong to a dropped fork. The tradeoff is that
  there is typically at least a 32 slot difference between the most recent
  confirmed block and the most recent finalized block. This tradeoff is pretty
  severe and effectively reduces the expiration of your transactions by about 13
  seconds but this could be even more during unstable cluster conditions.

### Use an appropriate preflight commitment level

If your transaction uses a blockhash that was fetched from one RPC node then you
send, or simulate, that transaction with a different RPC node, you could run
into issues due to one node lagging behind the other.

When RPC nodes receive a `sendTransaction` request, they will attempt to
determine the expiration block of your transaction using the most recent
finalized block or with the block selected by the `preflightCommitment`
parameter. A **VERY** common issue is that a received transaction’s blockhash
was produced after the block used to calculate the expiration for that
transaction. If an RPC node can’t determine when your transaction expires, it
will only forward your transaction **one time** and then will **drop** the
transaction.

Similarly, when RPC nodes receive a `simulateTransaction` request, they will
simulate your transaction using the most recent finalized block or with the
block selected by the `preflightCommitment` parameter. If the block chosen for
simulation is older than the block used for your transaction’s blockhash, the
simulation will fail with the dreaded “blockhash not found” error.

**Recommendation**

Even if you use `skipPreflight`, **ALWAYS** set the `preflightCommitment`
parameter to the same commitment level used to fetch your transaction’s
blockhash for both `sendTransaction` and `simulateTransaction` requests.

### Be wary of lagging RPC nodes when sending transactions

When your application uses an RPC pool service or when the RPC endpoint differs
between creating a transaction and sending a transaction, you need to be wary of
situations where one RPC node is lagging behind the other. For example, if you
fetch a transaction blockhash from one RPC node then you send that transaction
to a second RPC node for forwarding or simulation, the second RPC node might be
lagging behind the first.

**Recommendation**

For `sendTransaction` requests, clients should keep resending a transaction to a
RPC node on a frequent interval so that if an RPC node is slightly lagging
behind the cluster, it will eventually catch up and detect your transaction’s
expiration properly.

For `simulateTransaction` requests, clients should use the
[`replaceRecentBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/simulatetransaction) parameter to tell
the RPC node to replace the simulated transaction’s blockhash with a blockhash
that will always be valid for simulation.

### Avoid reusing stale blockhashes

Even if your application has fetched a very recent blockhash, be sure that
you’re not reusing that blockhash in transactions for too long. The ideal
scenario is that a recent blockhash is fetched right before a user signs their
transaction.

**Recommendation for applications**

Poll for new recent blockhashes on a frequent basis to ensure that whenever a
user triggers an action that creates a transaction, your application already has
a fresh blockhash that’s ready to go.

**Recommendation for wallets**

Poll for new recent blockhashes on a frequent basis and replace a transaction’s
recent blockhash right before they sign the transaction to ensure the blockhash
is as fresh as possible.

### Use healthy RPC nodes when fetching blockhashes

By fetching the latest blockhash with the `"confirmed"` commitment level from an
RPC node, it’s going to respond with the blockhash for the latest confirmed
block that it’s aware of. Solana’s block propagation protocol prioritizes
sending blocks to staked nodes so RPC nodes naturally lag about a block behind
the rest of the cluster. They also have to do more work to handle application
requests and can lag a lot more under heavy user traffic.

Lagging RPC nodes can therefore respond to blockhash requests with blockhashes
that were confirmed by the cluster quite awhile ago. By default, a lagging RPC
node detects that it is more than 150 slots behind the cluster will stop
responding to requests, but just before hitting that threshold they can still
return a blockhash that is just about to expire.

**Recommendation**

Monitor the health of your RPC nodes to ensure that they have an up-to-date view
of the cluster state with one of the following methods:

1. Fetch your RPC node’s highest processed slot by using the
   [`getSlot`](/docs/rpc/http/getslot) RPC API with the `"processed"` commitment
   level and then call the
   [`getMaxShredInsertSlot](/docs/rpc/http/getmaxshredinsertslot) RPC API to get
   the highest slot that your RPC node has received a “shred” of a block for. If
   the difference between these responses is very large, the cluster is
   producing blocks far ahead of what the RPC node has processed.
2. Call the `getLatestBlockhash` RPC API with the `"confirmed"` commitment level
   on a few different RPC API nodes and use the blockhash from the node that
   returns the highest slot for its
   [context slot](/docs/rpc#rpcresponse-structure).

### Wait long enough for expiration

**Recommendation**

When calling [`getLatestBlockhash`](/docs/rpc/http/getlatestblockhash) RPC API
to get a recent blockhash for your transaction, take note of the
`"lastValidBlockHeight"` in the response.

Then, poll the [`getBlockHeight`](/docs/rpc/http/getblockheight) RPC API with
the “confirmed” commitment level until it returns a block height greater than
the previously returned last valid block height.

### Consider using “durable” transactions

Sometimes transaction expiration issues are really hard to avoid (e.g. offline
signing, cluster instability). If the previous tips are still not sufficient for
your use-case, you can switch to using durable transactions (they just require a
bit of setup).

To start using durable transactions, a user first needs to submit a transaction
that
[invokes instructions that create a special on-chain “nonce” account](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/system_instruction/fn.create_nonce_account.html)
and stores a “durable blockhash” inside of it. At any point in the future (as
long as the nonce account hasn’t been used yet), the user can create a durable
transaction by following these 2 rules:

1. The instruction list must start with an
   [“advance nonce” system instruction](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/system_instruction/fn.advance_nonce_account.html)
   which loads their on-chain nonce account
2. The transaction’s blockhash must be equal to the durable blockhash stored by
   the on-chain nonce account

Here’s how these transactions are processed by the Solana runtime:

1. If the transaction’s blockhash is no longer “recent”, the runtime checks if
   the transaction’s instruction list begins with an “advance nonce” system
   instruction
2. If so, it then loads the nonce account specified by the “advance nonce”
   instruction
3. Then it checks that the stored durable blockhash matches the transaction’s
   blockhash
4. Lastly it makes sure to advance the nonce account’s stored blockhash to the
   latest recent blockhash to ensure that the same transaction can never be
   processed again

For more details about how these durable transactions work, you can read the
[original proposal](./../implemented-proposals/durable-tx-nonces.md) and
[check out an example](./clients/javascript-reference#nonceaccount) in the
Solana docs.
