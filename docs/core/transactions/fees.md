The small fees paid to process
[instructions](./../../terminology.md#instruction) on the Solana blockchain are
known as "_transaction fees_".

As each transaction (which contains one or more instructions) is sent through
the network, it gets processed by the current leader validation-client. Once
confirmed as a global state transaction, this _transaction fee_ is paid to the
network to help support the economic design of the Solana blockchain.

### Transaction Fee Calculation

Currently, the amount of resources consumed by a transaction do not impact fees
in any way. This is because the runtime imposes a small cap on the amount of
resources that transaction instructions can use, not to mention that the size of
transactions is limited as well. So right now, transaction fees are solely
determined by the number of signatures that need to be verified in a
transaction. The only limit on the number of signatures in a transaction is the
max size of transaction itself. Each signature (64 bytes) in a transaction (max
1232 bytes) must reference a unique public key (32 bytes) so a single
transaction could contain as many as 12 signatures (not sure why you would do
that). The fee per transaction signature can be fetched with the `solana` cli:

```bash
$ solana fees
Blockhash: 8eULQbYYp67o5tGF2gxACnBCKAE39TetbYYMGTx3iBFc
Lamports per signature: 5000
Last valid block height: 94236543
```

The `solana` cli `fees` subcommand calls the `getFees` RPC API method to
retrieve the above output information, so your application can call that method
directly as well:

```bash
$ curl http://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getFees"}
'

# RESULT (lastValidSlot removed since it's inaccurate)
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "context": {
      "slot": 106818885
    },
    "value": {
      "blockhash": "78e3YBCMXJBiPD1HpyVtVfFzZFPG6nUycnQcyNMSUQzB",
      "feeCalculator": {
        "lamportsPerSignature": 5000
      },
      "lastValidBlockHeight": 96137823
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Fee Determinism

It's important to keep in mind that fee rates (such as `lamports_per_signature`)
are subject to change from block to block (though that hasn't happened in the
full history of the `mainnet-beta` cluster). Despite the fact that fees can
fluctuate, fees for a transaction can still be calculated deterministically when
creating (and before signing) a transaction. This determinism comes from the
fact that fees are applied using the rates from the block whose blockhash
matches the `recent_blockhash` field in a transaction. Blockhashes can only be
referenced by a transaction for a few minutes before they expire.

Transactions with expired blockhashes will be ignored and dropped by the
cluster, so it's important to understand how expiration actually works. Before
transactions are added to a block and during block validation,
[each transaction's recent blockhash is checked](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/647aa926673e3df4443d8b3d9e3f759e8ca2c44b/runtime/src/bank.rs#L3482)
to ensure it hasn't expired yet. The max age of a transaction's blockhash is
only 150 blocks. This means that if no slots are skipped in between, the
blockhash for block 100 would be usable by transactions processed in blocks 101
to 252, inclusive (during block 101 the age of block 100 is "0" and during block
252 its age is "150"). However, it's important to remember that slots may be
skipped and that age checks use "block height" _not_ "slot height". Since slots
are skipped occasionally, the actual age of a blockhash can be a bit longer than
150 slots. At the time of writing, slot times are about 500ms and skip rate is
about 5% so the expected lifetime of a transaction which uses the most recent
blockhash is about 1min 19s.

### Fee Collection

Transactions are required to have at least one account which has signed the
transaction and is writable. Writable signer accounts are serialized first in
the list of transaction accounts and the first of these accounts is always used
as the "fee payer".

Before any transaction instructions are processed, the fee payer account balance
will be deducted to pay for transaction fees. If the fee payer balance is not
sufficient to cover transaction fees, the transaction will be dropped by the
cluster. If the balance was sufficient, the fees will be deducted whether the
transaction is processed successfully or not. In fact, if any of the transaction
instructions return an error or violate runtime restrictions, all account
changes _except_ the transaction fee deduction will be rolled back.

### Fee Distribution

Transaction fees are partially burned and the remaining fees are collected by
the validator that produced the block that the corresponding transactions were
included in. The transaction fee burn rate was initialized as 50% when inflation
rewards were enabled at the beginning of 2021 and has not changed so far. These
fees incentivize a validator to process as many transactions as possible during
its slots in the leader schedule. Collected fees are deposited in the
validator's account (listed in the leader schedule for the current slot) after
processing all of the transactions included in a block.
