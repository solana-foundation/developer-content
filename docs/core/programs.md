In the Solana ecosystem, "smart contracts" are called programs. Each
[program](http://localhost:3002/docs/core/accounts#program-account) is an
on-chain account that stores executable logic, organized into specific functions
referred to as
[instructions](http://localhost:3002/docs/core/transactions#instruction).

Solana programs are predominantly written in the
[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) programming language, with two common
approaches for development:

- [Anchor](/docs/core/programs/anchor): A framework designed for Solana program
  development. It provides a faster and simpler way to write programs, using
  Rust macros to significantly reduce boilerplate code. For beginners, it is
  recommended to start with the Anchor framework.

- [Native Rust](/docs/core/programs/rust): This approach involves writing Solana
  programs directly in Rust without leveraging any frameworks. It offers more
  flexibility but comes with increased complexity.

For more details related to Solana Programs refer to the pages included under
the [programs](/docs/programs) section.
