On Solana, we send [transactions](/docs/core/transactions#transaction) made up
of [instructions](/docs/core/transactions#instruction) to interact with the
network.

You can think of instructions as APIs that programs expose to the network, where
each instruction on a program represents a specific API endpoint. Then imagine a
transaction on Solana as bundling several API requests into a single, atomic
operation that enables you to interact with multiple services simultaneously.

For simplicity, a transaction can be thought of as a request to process one or
multiple instructions.

![Transaction Simplified](/assets/docs/core/transactions/transaction-simple.svg)

- If a transaction includes multiple instructions, the instructions are
  processed in the order they are added to the transaction.
- If any instruction on a transaction fails, then the whole transaction fails
  and none of the instructions get processed.

## Transaction

A Solana
[transaction](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/src/transaction/mod.rs#L173)
consists of:

1. **[Signatures](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/src/signature.rs#L27):**
   An array of signatures included on the transaction.
2. **[Message](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/message/legacy.rs#L110):**
   List of instructions to be processed atomically.

![Transaction Format](/assets/docs/core/transactions/tx_format.png)

The structure of a transaction message comprises of:

- **[Message Header](/docs/core/transactions#message-header)**: Specifies the
  number of signer and read-only account.
- **[Account Addresses](/docs/core/transactions#array-of-account-addresses)**:
  An array of account addresses required by the instructions on the transaction.
- **[Recent Blockhash](/docs/core/transactions#recent-blockhash)**: Acts as a
  timestamp for the transaction.
- **[Instructions](/docs/core/transactions#array-of-instructions)**: An array of
  instructions to be executed.

![Message](/assets/docs/core/transactions/legacy_message.png)

The Solana network uses a maximum transactional unit (MTU) size of 1280 bytes,
adherent to the [IPv6 MTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_packet) size
constraints to ensure speed and reliability. This leaves **1232 bytes** for
packet data like serialized transactions.

The total size of the signatures and message for a transaction is limited to
1232 bytes.

![Transaction Format](/assets/docs/core/transactions/issues_with_legacy_txs.png)

### Message Header

The
[message header](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/message/mod.rs#L96)
specifies the permissions of accounts include in the transaction's account
address array. It is comprised of three bytes, each containing a u8 integer,
which collectively specify:

1. The number of required signatures for the transaction.
2. The number of read-only account addresses that require signatures.
3. The number of read-only account addresses that do not require signatures.

![Message Header](/assets/docs/core/transactions/message_header.png)

### Array of Account Addresses

A transaction message includes an array containing all the
[account addresses](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/message/legacy.rs#L119)
needed for the instructions within the transaction.

This array starts with a
[compact-u16](/docs/core/transactions#compact-array-format) encoding of the
number of account addresses, followed by the addresses ordered by the
permissions required of the accounts:

- Accounts that are writable and signers
- Accounts that are read-only and signers
- Accounts that are writable and not signers
- Accounts that are read-only and not signers

![Compact array of account addresses](/assets/docs/core/transactions/compat_array_of_account_addresses.png)

### Recent Blockhash

All transactions include a
[recent blockhash](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/message/legacy.rs#L122)
to act as a timestamp for the transaction. The blockhash is used to prevent
duplications and eliminate stale transactions.

The max age of a transaction's blockhash is 150 blocks (~1 minute assuming 400ms
block times). If a transaction's blockhash is 150 blocks older than the latest
blockhash, it is considered expired. This means that transactions not processed
within a specific timeframe will never be executed.

### Array of Instructions

A transaction message includes an array of all
[instructions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/message/legacy.rs#L128)
requesting to be processed. Instructions within a transaction message are in the
format of
[CompiledInstruction](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/instruction.rs#L633).

Much like the array of account addresses, this compact array starts with a
[compact-u16](/docs/core/transactions#compact-array-format) encoding of the
number of instructions, followed by an array of instructions. Each instruction
in the array specifies the following information:

1. **Program ID**: Identifies an on-chain program that will process the
   instruction. This is represented as an u8 index pointing to an account
   address within the account addresses array.
2. **Compact array of account address indexes**: Array of u8 indexes pointing to
   the account addresses array for each account required by the instruction.
3. **Compact array of opaque u8 data**: A u8 byte array specific to the program
   invoked. This data specifies the instruction to invoke on the program along
   with any additional data that the instruction requires (such as function
   arguments).

![Compact array of Instructions](/assets/docs/core/transactions/compact_array_of_ixs.png)

### Transaction Logs

Below is an example of the structure of a transaction including a single
[SOL transfer](/docs/core/transactions#basic-examples) instruction. It shows the
message details including the header, account keys, blockhash, and the
instructions, along with the signature for the transaction.

```
"transaction": {
    "message": {
      "header": {
        "numReadonlySignedAccounts": 0,
        "numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts": 1,
        "numRequiredSignatures": 1
      },
      "accountKeys": [
        "3z9vL1zjN6qyAFHhHQdWYRTFAcy69pJydkZmSFBKHg1R",
        "5snoUseZG8s8CDFHrXY2ZHaCrJYsW457piktDmhyb5Jd",
        "11111111111111111111111111111111"
      ],
      "recentBlockhash": "DzfXchZJoLMG3cNftcf2sw7qatkkuwQf4xH15N5wkKAb",
      "instructions": [
        {
          "accounts": [
            0,
            1
          ],
          "data": "3Bxs4NN8M2Yn4TLb",
          "programIdIndex": 2,
          "stackHeight": null
        }
      ],
      "indexToProgramIds": {}
    },
    "signatures": [
      "5LrcE2f6uvydKRquEJ8xp19heGxSvqsVbcqUeFoiWbXe8JNip7ftPQNTAVPyTK7ijVdpkzmKKaAQR7MWMmujAhXD"
    ]
  }
```

## Instruction

An
[instruction](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/instruction.rs#L329)
is a request to process a specific action and is the smallest contiguous unit of
execution logic in a [program](/docs/core/accounts#program-account).

When building an instruction to add to a transaction, each instruction must
include the following information:

- **Program address**: Specifies the program being invoked
- **Accounts**: Lists every account the instruction reads from or writes to,
  including other programs
- **Instruction Data**: A byte arrya that specifies which instruction on the
  program to invoke, plus any additional data required by the instruction
  (function arguments)

![Transaction Instruction](/assets/docs/core/transactions/instruction.svg)

### AccountMeta

For every account required by an instruction, the following info must be
specified:

- **Account address**: The on-chain address of an account
- **is_signer**: Specify if the account is required as a signer on the
  transaction
- **is_writable**: Specify if the account data will be modified

This information is referred to as the
[AccountMeta](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/instruction.rs#L539).

![AccountMeta](/assets/docs/core/transactions/accountmeta.svg)

By specifying all accounts required by an instruction and whether each account
is writable, transactions can be processed in parallel.

For example, two transactions do not include any accounts that write to the same
state can be executed at the same time.

### Instruction Logs

Below is an example of the structure of a
[SOL transfer](/docs/core/transactions#basic-examples) instruction which details
the account keys, program ID, and data required by the instruction.

```
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "pubkey": "3z9vL1zjN6qyAFHhHQdWYRTFAcy69pJydkZmSFBKHg1R",
      "isSigner": true,
      "isWritable": true
    },
    {
      "pubkey": "BpvxsLYKQZTH42jjtWHZpsVSa7s6JVwLKwBptPSHXuZc",
      "isSigner": false,
      "isWritable": true
    }
  ],
  "programId": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "data": [2,0,0,0,128,150,152,0,0,0,0,0]
}
```

## Basic Examples

Below is a diagram representing a transaction with a single instruction to
transfer SOL from a sender to a receiver.

Individual "wallets" on Solana are accounts owned by the
[System Program](/docs/core/accounts#system-program). As part of the
[Solana Account Model](/docs/core/accounts), only the program that owns an
account is allowed to modify the data on the account.

Therefore, transferring SOL from a "wallet" account requires sending a
transaction to invoke the transfer instruction on the System Program.

![SOL Transfer](/assets/docs/core/transactions/sol-transfer.svg)

Once the transaction is sent, the System Program is invoked to process the
transfer instruction. The System Program then updates the lamport balances of
both the sender and recipient accounts accordingly.

![SOL Transfer Process](/assets/docs/core/transactions/sol-transfer-process.svg)

### Simple SOL Transfer

Here is [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a0ea7fb53fa325bfd0c3e)
example of how to build a SOL transfer instruction using the
`SystemProgram.transfer` method:

```typescript
// Define the amount to transfer
const transferAmount = 0.01; // 0.01 SOL

// Create a transfer instruction for transferring SOL from wallet_1 to wallet_2
const transferInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: sender.publicKey,
  toPubkey: receiver.publicKey,
  lamports: transferAmount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, // Convert transferAmount to lamports
});

// Add the transfer instruction to a new transaction
const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);
```

### Manual SOL Transfer

Here is a [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a102efb53fa325bfd0c3f)
example of how to manually build the same SOL transfer instruction:

```typescript
// Define the amount to transfer
const transferAmount = 0.01; // 0.01 SOL

// Instruction index for the SystemProgram transfer instruction
const transferInstructionIndex = 2;

// Create a buffer for the data to be passed to the transfer instruction
const instructionData = Buffer.alloc(4 + 8); // uint32 + uint64
// Write the instruction index to the buffer
instructionData.writeUInt32LE(transferInstructionIndex, 0);
// Write the transfer amount to the buffer
instructionData.writeBigUInt64LE(BigInt(transferAmount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL), 4);

// Manually create a transfer instruction for transferring SOL from sender to receiver
const transferInstruction = new TransactionInstruction({
  keys: [
    { pubkey: sender.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },
    { pubkey: receiver.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
  ],
  programId: SystemProgram.programId,
  data: instructionData,
});

// Add the transfer instruction to a new transaction
const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);
```

Under the hood, the `SystemProgram.transfer` method is functionally equivalent
to the more verbose example above. The `SystemProgram.transfer` method simply
abstracts away the details of creating the instruction data buffer and
`AccountMeta` for each account required by the instruction.

The details for building program instructions are often abstracted away by
client libraries. However, if one is not available, you can always fall back to
manually building the instruction.

## Compact-Array Format

A compact array is an array serialized in the following format:

1. The length of the array, encoded as
   [compact-u16](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/short_vec.rs).
2. The individual items of the array, listed sequentially after the length.

![Compact array format](/assets/docs/core/transactions/compact_array_format.png)

This encoding method is used to specify the lengths of both the
[Account Addresses](/docs/core/transactions#array-of-account-addresses) and
[Instructions](/docs/core/transactions#array-of-instructions) arrays within a
transaction message.
