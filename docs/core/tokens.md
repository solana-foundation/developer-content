This section will cover the basics of how tokens are represented on Solana. You
can think of tokens as a counter in a database that also keeps track of the
ownership for each unit of the count.

On Solana, these are referred to as SPL
([Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library))
Tokens.

- The [Token Program](/docs/core/tokens#token-program) stores all the
  instruction logic for interacting with tokens on the network (both fungible
  and non-fungible).

- A [Mint Account](/docs/core/tokens#mint-account) is a global counter that
  represents a specific type of token, and stores global metadata about the
  token such as the total supply and mint authority (address authorized to
  create new units of a token).

- A [Token Account](/docs/core/tokens#token-account) is an individual counter
  that keeps track of how many units of a specific type of token (mint account)
  are owned by a specific address.

<Callout>
  There are currently two versions of the Token Program. The original [Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program) and the [Token Extensions Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program-2022) (Token2022). The Token Extensions
  Program functions the same as the original Token Program, but with additional
  features and improvements. The Token Extensions Program is the recommended
  version to use for creating new tokens (mint accounts).

## Token Program

The
[Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program)
stores all the instruction logic for interacting with tokens on the network
(both fungible and non-fungible). All tokens on Solana are effectively
[data accounts](/docs/core/accounts#data-account) owned by the Token Program.

You can find the full list of Token Program instructions
[here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/instruction.rs).

![Token Program](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-program.svg)

A few commonly used instructions include:

- [`InitializeMint`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L29):
  Create a new mint account to represent a new type of token.
- [`InitializeAccount`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L84):
  Create a new token account to hold units of a specific type of token (mint).
- [`MintTo`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L522):
  Create new units of a specific type of token and add them to a token account.
  This increases the supply of the token and can only be done by the mint
  authority of the mint account.
- [`Transfer`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/processor.rs#L228):
  Transfer units of a specific type of token from one token account to another.

## Mint Account

Tokens on Solana are uniquely identified by the address of a
[Mint Account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L18-L32)
owned by the Token Program. This account is effectively a global counter for a
specific token, and stores data such as:

- Supply: Total supply of the token
- Decimals: Decimal precision of the token
- Mint authority: The account authorized to create new units of the token, thus
  increasing the supply
- Freeze authority: The account authorized to freeze tokens from being
  transferred from "token accounts"

![Mint Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/mint-account.svg)

The full details stored on each Mint Account include the following:

```rust
pub struct Mint {
    /// Optional authority used to mint new tokens. The mint authority may only
    /// be provided during mint creation. If no mint authority is present
    /// then the mint has a fixed supply and no further tokens may be
    /// minted.
    pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// Total supply of tokens.
    pub supply: u64,
    /// Number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
    pub decimals: u8,
    /// Is `true` if this structure has been initialized
    pub is_initialized: bool,
    /// Optional authority to freeze token accounts.
    pub freeze_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

For reference, here is a Solana Explorer link to the USDC
[Mint Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v).

### Create Mint Account

Creating a new Mint Account requires sending a transaction with two
instructions. Here an example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce32ecffcf4b13384d00f).

1. Invoke the System Program to create a new account with enough space for the
   Mint Account data and then transfer ownership to the Token Program.

2. Invoke the Token Program to initialize the data of the new account as a Mint
   Account

First, generate a keypair to use as the address of the new account and calculate
the amount of lamports needed for the Mint Account data.

```ts
// Generate keypair to use as address of mint account
const mint = new Keypair();

// Calculate minimum lamports for space required by mint account
const rentLamports = await getMinimumBalanceForRentExemptMint(connection);
```

Next, create the instruction invoking the System Program to create a new
account.

```ts
const createAccountInstruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
  fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
  newAccountPubkey: mint.publicKey,
  space: MINT_SIZE,
  lamports: rentLamports,
  programId: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
});
```

Next, create the instruction invoking the Token Program to initialize the Mint
Account data.

```ts
const initializeMintInstruction = createInitializeMint2Instruction(
  mint.publicKey,
  2, // decimals
  wallet.publicKey, // mint authority
  wallet.publicKey, // freeze authority
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

Next, add both instructions to a new transaction.

```ts
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  createAccountInstruction,
  initializeMintInstruction,
);
```

Finally, send the transaction. The `wallet.keypair` is the transaction fee payer
and account paying the lamports required by the new mint account. The `mint`
keypair is also included as a signer on the transaction because we are using its
publickey as the address of the new account.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet.keypair, // payer
    mint, // mint address keypair
  ],
);
```

## Token Account

To hold units of a specific token, another type of data account owned by the
Token Program must be created. This account is referred to as a
[Token Account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token/program/src/state.rs#L89-L110).

The most commonly referenced data stored on the Token Account include the
following:

- Mint: The type of token the Token Account holds units of
- Owner: The account authorized to transfer tokens out of the Token Account
- Amount: Units of the token the Token Account currently holds

![Token Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account.svg)

The full details stored on each Token Account includes the following:

```rust
pub struct Account {
    /// The mint associated with this account
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    /// The owner of this account.
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    /// The amount of tokens this account holds.
    pub amount: u64,
    /// If `delegate` is `Some` then `delegated_amount` represents
    /// the amount authorized by the delegate
    pub delegate: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// The account's state
    pub state: AccountState,
    /// If is_native.is_some, this is a native token, and the value logs the
    /// rent-exempt reserve. An Account is required to be rent-exempt, so
    /// the value is used by the Processor to ensure that wrapped SOL
    /// accounts do not drop below this threshold.
    pub is_native: COption<u64>,
    /// The amount delegated
    pub delegated_amount: u64,
    /// Optional authority to close the account.
    pub close_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

For a wallet to own units of a certain token, it needs to create a token account
for a specific type of token (mint) that designates the wallet as the owner of
the token account. A wallet can create multiple token accounts for the same type
of token, but each token account can only be owned by one wallet and hold units
of one type of token.

![Account Relationship](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account-relationship.svg)

Note that each Token Account's data includes an â€œowner" field used to identify
who has authority over that specific Token Account. This is separate from the
program owner specified in the AccountInfo, which is the Token Program for all
Token Accounts.

### Create Token Account

Creating a new Token Account requires sending a transaction with two
instructions. Here an example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce716cffcf4b13384d010).

1. Invoke the System Program to create a new account with enough space for the
   Token Account data and then transfer ownership to the Token Program.

2. Invoke the Token Program to initialize the data of the new account as a Token
   Account

First, generate a keypair to use as the address of the new account and calculate
the amount of lamports needed for the Token Account data.

```ts
// Generate keypair to use as address of token account
const token = Keypair.generate();

// Calculate minimum lamports for space required by token account
const rentLamports = await getMinimumBalanceForRentExemptAccount(connection);
```

Next, create the instruction invoking the System Program to create a new
account.

```ts
const createAccountInstruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
  fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
  newAccountPubkey: token.publicKey,
  space: ACCOUNT_SIZE,
  lamports: rentLamports,
  programId: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
});
```

Next, create the instruction invoking the Token Program to initialize the Token
Account data.

```ts
const initializeAccountInstruction = createInitializeAccountInstruction(
  token.publicKey, // token account address
  mint, // mint address
  wallet.publicKey, // token account owner
);
```

Next, add both instructions to a new transaction.

```ts
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  createAccountInstruction,
  initializeAccountInstruction,
);
```

Finally, send the transaction. The `wallet.keypair` is the transaction fee payer
and account paying the lamports required by the new mint account. The `token`
keypair is also included as a signer on the transaction because we are using its
publickey as the address of the new account.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet.keypair, // payer
    token, // token address keypair
  ],
);
```

## Associated Token Account

To simplify the process of locating a token account's address for a specific
mint and owner, we often use Associated Token Accounts.

An Associated Token Account is a token account whose address is
deterministically derived using the owner's address and the mint account's
address. You can think of the Associated Token Account as the "default" token
account for a specific mint and owner.

It's important to understand that an Associated Token Account isn't a different
type of token account. It's just a token account with a specific address.

![Associated Token Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/associated-token-account.svg)

This introduces a key concept in Solana development:
[Program Derived Address (PDA)](/docs/core/pda). Conceptually, a PDA provides a
deterministic way to generate an address using some predefined inputs. This
enables us to easily find the address of an account at a later time.

Here is a [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a2dd0fb53fa325bfd0c41)
example that derives the USDC Associated Token Account address and owner. It
will always generate the
[same address](https://explorer.solana.com/address/4kokFKCFMxpCpG41yLYkLEqXW8g1WPfCt2NC9KGivY6N)
for the same mint and owner.

```ts
const associatedTokenAccountAddress = getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(
  USDC_MINT_ADDRESS,
  OWNER_ADDRESS,
);
```

Specifically, the address for an Associated Token Account is derived using the
following inputs. Here is a
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a31d0fb53fa325bfd0c42) example that
generates the same address as the previous example.

```ts
const [PDA, bump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [
    OWNER_ADDRESS.toBuffer(),
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(),
    USDC_MINT_ADDRESS.toBuffer(),
  ],
  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

For two wallets to hold units of the same type of token, each wallet needs its
own token account for the specific mint account.

### Create Associated Token Account

Creating an Associated Token Account only requires a single instruction that
invokes the
[Associated Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/associated-token-account/program/src).
Here an example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce868cffcf4b13384d011).

The Associated Token Program uses [Cross Program Invocations](/docs/core/cpi) to
handle:

- [Invoking the System Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/associated-token-account/program/src/tools/account.rs#L19)
  to create a new account using the provided PDA as the address of the new
  account
- [Invoking the Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L138-L161)
  to initialize the Token Account data for the new account.

First, derive the PDA for the Associated Token Account.

```ts
const associatedTokenAccountAddress = getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(
  mint, // mint address
  wallet.publicKey, // token account owner
  false, // allow owner off-curve (PDA)
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

Next, create the instruction invoking the Associated Token Program.

```ts
const instruction = createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
  wallet.publicKey, // payer
  associatedTokenAccountAddress, // token account address
  wallet.publicKey, // owner
  mint, // mint address
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

Next, add the instruction to a new transaction.

```ts
const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
```

Finally, send the transaction. The `wallet.keypair` is the transaction fee payer
and account paying the lamports required by the new token account.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet.keypair, // payer
  ],
);
```

## Mint Tokens

To create new units of a token, invoke the `MintTo` instruction on the Token
Program. This instruction must be signed by the mint authority. The instruction
mints new units of the token to a Token Account and increases the total supply
on the Mint Account. Here an example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660cea45cffcf4b13384d012).

First, create an instruction to invoke the Token Program.

```ts
const instruction = createMintToInstruction(
  mint, // mint address
  tokenAccount, // destination
  wallet.publicKey, // mint authority
  100, // amount
  [],
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

Next, add the instruction to a new transaction.

```ts
const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
```

Finally, send the transaction. The mint authority for the mint account must be a
signer on the transaction.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet.keypair, // payer, mint authority
  ],
);
```

## Transfer Tokens

To transfer tokens, invoke the `Transfer` instruction on the Token Program. This
instruction must be signed by the owner of the Token Account. The instruction
transfers units of a token from one Token Account to another Token Account. Here
an example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ced84cffcf4b13384d013).

First, create an instruction to invoke the Token Program.

```ts
const instruction = createTransferInstruction(
  sourceTokenAccount.address, // transfer from
  destinationTokenAccount.address, // transfer to
  wallet.publicKey, // source token account owner
  100, // amount
  [],
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

Next, add the instruction to a new transaction.

```ts
const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
```

Finally, send the transaction. The mint authority for the mint account must be a
signer on the transaction.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet.keypair, // payer, owner
  ],
);
```

It's important to understand that both the sender and recipient must have
existing token accounts for the specific type of token being transferred. The
sender can include instructions to create the recipient's token account, which
generally is the Associated Token Account.

## Token Metadata

The Token Extensions Program enables additional metadata (such as name, symbol,
link to image) to be stored directly on the Mint Account. Here an example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/65964e90cffcf4b13384ceca). You can
learn more on the
[Metadata Extension Guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/metadata-pointer).
