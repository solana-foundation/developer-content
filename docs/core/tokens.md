Tokens are digital assets that represent ownership over diverse categories of
assets. Tokenization enables the digitalization of property rights, serving as a
fundamental component for managing both fungible and non-fungible assets.

- Fungible Tokens represent interchangeable and divisible assets of the same
  type and value (ex. USDC).
- Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) represent ownership of indivisible assets (ex. Art).

This section will cover the basics of how tokens are represented on Solana.
These are referred to as SPL
([Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library))
Tokens.

- The [Token Program](/docs/core/tokens#token-program) contains all the
  instruction logic for interacting with tokens on the network (both fungible
  and non-fungible).

- A [Mint Account](/docs/core/tokens#mint-account) represents a specific type of
  token and stores global metadata about the token such as the total supply and
  mint authority (address authorized to create new units of a token).

- A [Token Account](/docs/core/tokens#token-account) keeps track of individual
  ownership of how many units of a specific type of token (mint account) are
  owned by a specific address.

<Callout>
  There are currently two versions of the Token Program. The original [Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program) and the [Token Extensions Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program-2022) (Token2022). The Token Extensions
  Program functions the same as the original Token Program, but with additional
  features and improvements. The Token Extensions Program is the recommended
  version to use for creating new tokens (mint accounts).
</Callout>

## Token Program

The
[Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program)
contains all the instruction logic for interacting with tokens on the network
(both fungible and non-fungible). All tokens on Solana are effectively
[data accounts](/docs/core/accounts#data-account) owned by the Token Program.

You can find the full list of Token Program instructions
[here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/instruction.rs).

![Token Program](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-program.svg)

A few commonly used instructions include:

- [`InitializeMint`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/processor.rs#L29):
  Create a new mint account to represent a new type of token.
- [`InitializeAccount`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/processor.rs#L84):
  Create a new token account to hold units of a specific type of token (mint).
- [`MintTo`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/processor.rs#L522):
  Create new units of a specific type of token and add them to a token account.
  This increases the supply of the token and can only be done by the mint
  authority of the mint account.
- [`Transfer`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/processor.rs#L228):
  Transfer units of a specific type of token from one token account to another.

### Mint Account

Tokens on Solana are uniquely identified by the address of a
[Mint Account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/state.rs#L18-L32)
owned by the Token Program. This account is effectively a global counter for a
specific token, and stores data such as:

- Supply: Total supply of the token
- Decimals: Decimal precision of the token
- Mint authority: The account authorized to create new units of the token, thus
  increasing the supply
- Freeze authority: The account authorized to freeze tokens from being
  transferred from "token accounts"

![Mint Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/mint-account.svg)

The full details stored on each Mint Account include the following:

```rust
pub struct Mint {
    /// Optional authority used to mint new tokens. The mint authority may only
    /// be provided during mint creation. If no mint authority is present
    /// then the mint has a fixed supply and no further tokens may be
    /// minted.
    pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// Total supply of tokens.
    pub supply: u64,
    /// Number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
    pub decimals: u8,
    /// Is `true` if this structure has been initialized
    pub is_initialized: bool,
    /// Optional authority to freeze token accounts.
    pub freeze_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

For reference, here is a Solana Explorer link to the USDC
[Mint Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v).

### Token Account

To track the individual ownership of each unit of a specific token, another type
of data account owned by the Token Program must be created. This account is
referred to as a
[Token Account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/state.rs#L89-L110).

The most commonly referenced data stored on the Token Account include the
following:

- Mint: The type of token the Token Account holds units of
- Owner: The account authorized to transfer tokens out of the Token Account
- Amount: Units of the token the Token Account currently holds

![Token Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account.svg)

The full details stored on each Token Account includes the following:

```rust
pub struct Account {
    /// The mint associated with this account
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    /// The owner of this account.
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    /// The amount of tokens this account holds.
    pub amount: u64,
    /// If `delegate` is `Some` then `delegated_amount` represents
    /// the amount authorized by the delegate
    pub delegate: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// The account's state
    pub state: AccountState,
    /// If is_native.is_some, this is a native token, and the value logs the
    /// rent-exempt reserve. An Account is required to be rent-exempt, so
    /// the value is used by the Processor to ensure that wrapped SOL
    /// accounts do not drop below this threshold.
    pub is_native: COption<u64>,
    /// The amount delegated
    pub delegated_amount: u64,
    /// Optional authority to close the account.
    pub close_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

For a wallet to own units of a certain token, it needs to create a token account
for a specific type of token (mint) that designates the wallet as the owner of
the token account. A wallet can create multiple token accounts for the same type
of token, but each token account can only be owned by one wallet and hold units
of one type of token.

![Account Relationship](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account-relationship.svg)

Note that each Token Account's data includes an “owner" field used to identify
who has authority over that specific Token Account. This is separate from the
program owner specified in the AccountInfo, which is the Token Program for all
Token Accounts.

### Associated Token Account

To simplify the process of locating a token account's address for a specific
mint and owner, we often use Associated Token Accounts.

An Associated Token Account is a token account whose address is
deterministically derived using the owner's address and the mint account's
address. You can think of the Associated Token Account as the "default" token
account for a specific mint and owner.

It's important to understand that an Associated Token Account isn't a different
type of token account. It's just a token account with a specific address.

![Associated Token Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/associated-token-account.svg)

This introduces a key concept in Solana development:
[Program Derived Address (PDA)](/docs/core/pda). Conceptually, a PDA provides a
deterministic way to generate an address using some predefined inputs. This
enables us to easily find the address of an account at a later time.

Here is a [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a2dd0fb53fa325bfd0c41)
example that derives the USDC Associated Token Account address and owner. It
will always generate the
[same address](https://explorer.solana.com/address/4kokFKCFMxpCpG41yLYkLEqXW8g1WPfCt2NC9KGivY6N)
for the same mint and owner.

```ts
const associatedTokenAccountAddress = getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(
  USDC_MINT_ADDRESS,
  OWNER_ADDRESS,
);
```

Specifically, the address for an Associated Token Account is derived using the
following inputs. Here is a
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/656a31d0fb53fa325bfd0c42) example that
generates the same address as the previous example.

```ts
const [PDA, bump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [
    OWNER_ADDRESS.toBuffer(),
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(),
    USDC_MINT_ADDRESS.toBuffer(),
  ],
  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

For two wallets to hold units of the same type of token, each wallet needs its
own token account for the specific mint account.

![Accounts Relationship Expanded](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account-relationship-ata.svg)

## Token Examples

The `spl-token` CLI can be used to experiment with SPL tokens. In the examples
below, we'll use the [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/) terminal to run
the CLI commands.

Creating tokens and accounts requires SOL for account rent deposits and
transaction fees. If it is your first time using Solana Playground, created a
Playground wallet and run the `solana airdrop` command in the Playground
terminal. You can also get devnet SOL using this
[faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

```sh
solana airdrop 2
```

Run `spl-token --help` for a full description of available commands.

```sh
spl-token --help
```

Alternatively, you can install the spl-token CLI locally using the following
command. This requires first installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/).

```sh
cargo install spl-token-cli
```

### Create a New Token

To create a new token ([mint account](/docs/core/tokens#mint-account)) run the
following command in the Solana Playground terminal.

```sh
spl-token create-token
```

You should see an output similar to the following. You can inspect both the
token and transaction details on
[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) using the
`Address` and `Signature`.

The unique identifier of the new token is
`99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg`.

```console filename="terminal" /99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg/
Creating token 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg

Address:  99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
Decimals:  9

Signature: 44fvKfT1ezBUwdzrCys3fvCdFxbLMnNvBstds76QZyE6cXag5NupBprSXwxPTzzjrC3cA6nvUZaLFTvmcKyzxrm1
```

New tokens initially have no supply. You can check the current supply of a token
using the following command:

```sh
spl-token supply <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

Running the `supply` command for a newly created token will return a value of
`0`.

```sh /99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg/
spl-token supply 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
```

Under the hood, creating a new Mint Account requires sending a transaction with
two instructions. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce32ecffcf4b13384d00f).

1. Invoke the System Program to create a new account with enough space for the
   Mint Account data and then transfer ownership to the Token Program.

2. Invoke the Token Program to initialize the data of the new account as a Mint
   Account

### Create Token Account

To hold units of a particular token, you must first create a
[token account](/docs/core/tokens#token-account). To create a new token account,
use the following command:

```sh
spl-token create-account [OPTIONS] <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

For example, running the following command in the Solana Playground terminal:

```sh /99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg/
spl-token create-account 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
```

Returns the following output.

- `AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9` is the address of the token
  account created to hold units of the token specified in the `create-account`
  command.

```console filename="terminal" /AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9/
Creating account AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9

Signature: 2BtrynuCLX9CNofFiaw6Yzbx6hit66pup9Sk7aFjwU2NEbFz7NCHD9w9sWhrCfEd73XveAGK1DxFpJoQZPXU9tS1
```

By default the `create-account` command creates an
[associated token account](/docs/core/tokens#associated-token-account) with your
wallet address as the token account owner.

You can create a token account for different owner using the following command:

```sh
spl-token create-account --owner <OWNER_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

For example, running the following command:

```sh /2i3KvjDCZWxBsqcxBHpdEaZYQwQSYE6LXUMx5VjY5XrR/
spl-token create-account --owner 2i3KvjDCZWxBsqcxBHpdEaZYQwQSYE6LXUMx5VjY5XrR 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
```

Returns the following output.

- `Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt` is the address of the token
  account created to hold units of the token specified in the `create-account`
  command and owned by the address specified following the `--owner` flag.

```console filename="terminal" /Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt/
Creating account Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt

Signature: 44vqKdfzspT592REDPY4goaRJH3uJ3Ce13G4BCuUHg35dVUbHuGTHvqn4ZjYF9BGe9QrjMfe9GmuLkQhSZCBQuEt
```

Under the hood, creating an Associated Token Account requires a single
instruction that invokes the
[Associated Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/associated-token-account/program/src).
Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce868cffcf4b13384d011).

The Associated Token Program uses [Cross Program Invocations](/docs/core/cpi) to
handle:

- [Invoking the System Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/associated-token-account/program/src/tools/account.rs#L19)
  to create a new account using the provided PDA as the address of the new
  account
- [Invoking the Token Program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/associated-token-account/program/src/processor.rs#L138-L161)
  to initialize the Token Account data for the new account.

Alternatively, creating a new Token Account using a randomly generated keypair
(not an Associated Token Account) requires sending a transaction with two
instructions. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce716cffcf4b13384d010).

1. Invoke the System Program to create a new account with enough space for the
   Token Account data and then transfer ownership to the Token Program.

2. Invoke the Token Program to initialize the data of the new account as a Token
   Account

### Mint Tokens

To create new units of a token, use the following command:

```sh
spl-token mint [OPTIONS] <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_AMOUNT> [--] [RECIPIENT_TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]
```

For example, running the following command:

```sh
spl-token mint 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg 100
```

Returns the following output.

- `99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg` is the address of the mint
  account that tokens are being minted for (increasing total supply).

- `AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9` is the address of your wallet's
  token account that units of the token are being minted to (increasing amount).

```console filename="terminal" /99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg/ /AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9/
Minting 100 tokens
  Token: 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
  Recipient: AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9

Signature: 2NJ1m7qCraPSBAVxbr2ssmWZmBU9Jc8pDtJAnyZsZJRcaYCYMqq1oRY1gqA4ddQno3g3xcnny5fzr1dvsnFKMEqG
```

To mint tokens to a different token account, specify the address of the intended
recipient token account. For example, running the following command:

```sh /Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt/
spl-token mint 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg 100 -- Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt
```

Returns the following output.

- `99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg` is the address of the mint
  account that tokens are being minted for (increasing total supply).

- `Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt` is the address of the token
  account that units of the token are being minted to (increasing amount).

```console filename="terminal" /99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg/ /Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt/
Minting 100 tokens
  Token: 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
  Recipient: Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt

Signature: 3SQvNM3o9DsTiLwcEkSPT1Edr14RgE2wC54TEjonEP2swyVCp2jPWYWdD6RwXUGpvDNUkKWzVBZVFShn5yntxVd7
```

Under the hood, creating new units of a token requires invoking the `MintTo`
instruction on the Token Program. This instruction must be signed by the mint
authority. The instruction mints new units of the token to a Token Account and
increases the total supply on the Mint Account. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660cea45cffcf4b13384d012).

### Transfer Tokens

To transfer units of a token between two token accounts, use the following
command:

```sh
spl-token transfer [OPTIONS] <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_AMOUNT> <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS
or RECIPIENT_TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

For example, running the following command:

```sh
spl-token transfer 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg 100 Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt
```

Returns the following output.

- `AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9` is the address of the token
  account that tokens are being transferred from. This would be the address of
  your token account for the specified token being transferred.

- `Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt` is the address of the token
  account that tokens are being transferred to.

```console filename="terminal" /AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9/ /Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt/
Transfer 100 tokens
  Sender: AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9
  Recipient: Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt

Signature: 5y6HVwV8V2hHGLTVmTmdySRiEUCZnWmkasAvJ7J6m7JR46obbGKCBqUFgLpZu5zQGwM4Xy6GZ4M5LKd1h6Padx3o
```

Under the hood, transferring tokens requires invoking the `Transfer` instruction
on the Token Program. This instruction must be signed by the owner of the
sender's Token Account. The instruction transfers units of a token from one
Token Account to another Token Account. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ced84cffcf4b13384d013).

It's important to understand that both the sender and recipient must have
existing token accounts for the specific type of token being transferred. The
sender can include additional instructions on the transaction to create the
recipient's token account, which generally is the Associated Token Account.

### Create Token Metadata

The Token Extensions Program enables additional metadata (such as name, symbol,
link to image) to be stored directly on the Mint Account.

<Callout>
   Using the Token Extensions CLI flags requires a local installation of the CLI:
   
   `cargo install --version 3.4.0 spl-token-cli`
</Callout>

To create a new token with the metadata extension enabled, using the following
command:

```sh
spl-token create-token --program-id TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb
--enable-metadata
```

The command returns the following output.

- `BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP` is the address of the new token
  created with the metadata extension enabled.

```console filename="terminal" /BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP/
Creating token BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP under program TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb
To initialize metadata inside the mint, please run `spl-token initialize-metadata BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP <YOUR_TOKEN_NAME> <YOUR_TOKEN_SYMBOL> <YOUR_TOKEN_URI>`, and sign with the mint authority.

Address:  BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP
Decimals:  9

Signature: 5iQofFeXdYhMi9uTzZghcq8stAaa6CY6saUwcdnELST13eNSifiuLbvR5DnRt311frkCTUh5oecj8YEvZSB3wfai
```

Once a new token is created with the metadata extension enabled, use the
following command to initialize the metadata.

```sh
spl-token initialize-metadata <TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS> <YOUR_TOKEN_NAME>
<YOUR_TOKEN_SYMBOL> <YOUR_TOKEN_URI>
```

The token uri is a link to off-chain metadata you want to associate with the
token. You can find an example of the JSON format
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-developers/opos-asset/main/assets/DeveloperPortal/metadata.json).

For example, running the following command will the additonal metadata directly
on the specified mint account.

```sh /BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP/
spl-token initialize-metadata BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP "TokenName" "TokenSymbol" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-developers/opos-asset/main/assets/DeveloperPortal/metadata.json"
```

You can then look up the address of the mint account on an explorer to inspect
the metadata. For example, here is a token created with the metadata extension
enabled on the
[SolanaFm](https://solana.fm/address/BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP?cluster=devnet-solana)
explorer.

You can learn more on the
[Metadata Extension Guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/metadata-pointer).
For more details related to various Token Extensions, refer to the
[Getting Started Guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/getting-started)
and the [SPL documentation](https://spl.solana.com/token-2022/extensions).
