Various Solana RPC methods will return more complex responses as structured JSON
objects, filled with specific keyed values.

The most common of these JSON data structures include:

- [transactions](#transactions)
- [inner instructions](#inner-instructions)
- [token balances](#token-balances)

## Transactions

Transactions are quite different from those on other blockchains. Be sure to
review [Anatomy of a Transaction](/docs/core/transactions.md) to learn about
transactions on Solana.

The JSON structure of a transaction is defined as follows:

- `signatures: <array[string]>` - A list of base-58 encoded signatures applied
  to the transaction. The list is always of length
  `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` and not empty. The signature at index
  `i` corresponds to the public key at index `i` in `message.accountKeys`. The
  first one is used as the
  [transaction id](/docs/terminology.md#transaction-id).
- `message: <object>` - Defines the content of the transaction.
  - `accountKeys: <array[string]>` - List of base-58 encoded public keys used by
    the transaction, including by the instructions and for signatures. The first
    `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` public keys must sign the
    transaction.
  - `header: <object>` - Details the account types and signatures required by
    the transaction.
    - `numRequiredSignatures: <number>` - The total number of signatures
      required to make the transaction valid. The signatures must match the
      first `numRequiredSignatures` of `message.accountKeys`.
    - `numReadonlySignedAccounts: <number>` - The last
      `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the signed keys are read-only accounts.
      Programs may process multiple transactions that load read-only accounts
      within a single PoH entry, but are not permitted to credit or debit
      lamports or modify account data. Transactions targeting the same
      read-write account are evaluated sequentially.
    - `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts: <number>` - The last
      `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts` of the unsigned keys are read-only accounts.
  - `recentBlockhash: <string>` - A base-58 encoded hash of a recent block in
    the ledger used to prevent transaction duplication and to give transactions
    lifetimes.
  - `instructions: <array[object]>` - List of program instructions that will be
    executed in sequence and committed in one atomic transaction if all succeed.
    - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array
      indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
    - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the
      `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the
      program.
    - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.
  - `addressTableLookups: <array[object]|undefined>` - List of address table
    lookups used by a transaction to dynamically load addresses from on-chain
    address lookup tables. Undefined if `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` is not
    set.
    - `accountKey: <string>` - base-58 encoded public key for an address lookup
      table account.
    - `writableIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load
      addresses of writable accounts from a lookup table.
    - `readonlyIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load
      addresses of readonly accounts from a lookup table.

## Inner Instructions

The Solana runtime records the cross-program instructions that are invoked
during transaction processing and makes these available for greater transparency
of what was executed on-chain per transaction instruction. Invoked instructions
are grouped by the originating transaction instruction and are listed in order
of processing.

The JSON structure of inner instructions is defined as a list of objects in the
following structure:

- `index: number` - Index of the transaction instruction from which the inner
  instruction(s) originated
- `instructions: <array[object]>` - Ordered list of inner program instructions
  that were invoked during a single transaction instruction.
  - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array
    indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
  - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the
    `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the
    program.
  - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.

## Token Balances

The JSON structure of token balances is defined as a list of objects in the
following structure:

- `accountIndex: <number>` - Index of the account in which the token balance is
  provided for.
- `mint: <string>` - Pubkey of the token's mint.
- `owner: <string|undefined>` - Pubkey of token balance's owner.
- `programId: <string|undefined>` - Pubkey of the Token program that owns the
  account.
- `uiTokenAmount: <object>` -
  - `amount: <string>` - Raw amount of tokens as a string, ignoring decimals.
  - `decimals: <number>` - Number of decimals configured for token's mint.
  - `uiAmount: <number|null>` - Token amount as a float, accounting for
    decimals. **DEPRECATED**
  - `uiAmountString: <string>` - Token amount as a string, accounting for
    decimals.
