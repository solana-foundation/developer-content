Solana is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance network
that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments,
and gaming. Solana operates as a single global state machine, and is open,
interoperable and decentralized.

## Getting started

Dive right into Solana to start building or setup your tooling.

- [Setup local environment](/content/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development.md) -
  Install the Solana CLI to get your local development environment setup
- [Hello World in your browser](/content/guides/getstarted/hello-world-in-your-browser.md) -
  Build and deploy your first on-chain Solana program, directly in your browser
  using Solana Playground

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Solana different
from other blockchains.

- [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions.md) - Collection of instructions for
  the blockchain to execute
- [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts.md) - Data and state storage mechanism for
  Solana
- [Programs](/docs/core/programs.md) - The executable code used to perform
  actions on the blockchain
- [Cross-Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi.md) - Core of the "composability" of
  Solana, this is how programs can "call" each other.

## Understanding the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how the proof-of-stake blockchain
works.

- [Validators](https://docs.solanalabs.com/validator/anatomy) - the individual
  nodes that are the backbone of the network
- [Clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/overview) - a collection of
  validators that work together for consensus

## Running a validator

Explore what it takes to operate a Solana validator and help secure the network.

- [System requirements](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements) -
  Recommended hardware requirements and expected SOL needed to operate a
  validator
- [Quick start guide](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-a-validator) -
  Setup a validator and get connected to a cluster for the first time
