The following terms are used throughout the Solana documentation and development
ecosystem.

## account

A record in the Solana ledger that either holds data or is an executable
program.

Like an account at a traditional bank, a Solana account may hold funds called
[lamports](#lamport). Like a file in Linux, it is addressable by a key, often
referred to as a [public key](#public-key-pubkey) or pubkey.

The key may be one of:

- an ed25519 public key
- a program-derived account address (32byte value forced off the ed25519 curve)
- a hash of an ed25519 public key with a 32 character string

## account owner

The address of the program that owns the account. Only the owning program is
capable of modifying the account.

See also [authority](#authority).

## app

A front-end application that interacts with a Solana cluster.

## authority

The address of a user that has some kind of permission over an account.

For example:

- The ability to mint new tokens is given to the account that is the 'mint
  authority' for the token mint.
- The ability to upgrade a program is given to the account that is the 'upgrade
  authority' of a program.

## bank state

The result of interpreting all programs on the ledger at a given
[tick height](#tick-height). It includes at least the set of all
[accounts](#account) holding nonzero [native tokens](#native-token).

## block

A contiguous set of [entries](#entry) on the ledger covered by a
[vote](#ledger-vote). A [leader](#leader) produces at most one block per
[slot](#slot).

## blockhash

A unique value ([hash](#hash)) that identifies a record (block). Solana computes
a blockhash from the last [entry id](#entry-id) of the block.

## block height

The number of [blocks](#block) beneath the current block. The first block after
the [genesis block](#genesis-block) has height one.

## bootstrap validator

The [validator](#validator) that produces the genesis (first) [block](#block) of
a block chain.

## BPF loader

The Solana program that owns and loads
[BPF](/docs/core/programs#berkeley-packet-filter-bpf)
[onchain programs](#onchain-program), allowing the program to interface with the
runtime.

## client

A computer program that accesses the Solana server network [cluster](#cluster).

## commitment

A measure of the network confirmation for the [block](#block).

## cluster

A set of [validators](#validator) maintaining a single [ledger](#ledger).

## compute budget

The maximum number of [compute units](#compute-units) consumed per transaction.

## compute units

The smallest unit of measure for consumption of computational resources of the
blockchain.

## confirmation time

The wallclock duration between a [leader](#leader) creating a
[tick entry](#tick) and creating a [confirmed block](#confirmed-block).

## confirmed block

A [block](#block) that has received a [super majority](#supermajority) of
[ledger votes](#ledger-vote).

## control plane

A gossip network connecting all [nodes](#node) of a [cluster](#cluster).

## cooldown period

Some number of [epochs](#epoch) after [stake](#stake) has been deactivated while
it progressively becomes available for withdrawal. During this period, the stake
is considered to be "deactivating". More info about:
[warmup and cooldown](https://docs.anza.xyz/implemented-proposals/staking-rewards#stake-warmup-cooldown-withdrawal)

## credit

See [vote credit](#vote-credit).

## cross-program invocation (CPI)

A call from one [onchain program](#onchain-program) to another. For more
information, see [calling between programs](/docs/core/cpi.md).

## data plane

A multicast network used to efficiently validate [entries](#entry) and gain
consensus.

## drone

An offchain service that acts as a custodian for a user's private key. It
typically serves to validate and sign transactions.

## entry

An entry on the [ledger](#ledger) either a [tick](#tick) or a
[transaction's entry](#transactions-entry).

## entry id

A preimage resistant [hash](#hash) over the final contents of an entry, which
acts as the [entry's](#entry) globally unique identifier. The hash serves as
evidence of:

- The entry being generated after a duration of time
- The specified [transactions](#transaction) are those included in the entry
- The entry's position with respect to other entries in [ledger](#ledger)

See [proof of history](#proof-of-history-poh).

## epoch

The time, i.e. number of [slots](#slot), for which a
[leader schedule](#leader-schedule) is valid.

## fee account

The fee account in the transaction is the account that pays for the cost of
including the transaction in the ledger. This is the first account in the
transaction. This account must be declared as Read-Write (writable) in the
transaction since paying for the transaction reduces the account balance.

## finality

When nodes representing 2/3rd of the [stake](#stake) have a common
[root](#root).

## fork

A [ledger](#ledger) derived from common entries but then diverged.

## genesis block

The first [block](#block) in the chain.

## genesis config

The configuration file that prepares the [ledger](#ledger) for the
[genesis block](#genesis-block).

## hash

A digital fingerprint of a sequence of bytes.

## inflation

An increase in token supply over time used to fund rewards for validation and to
fund continued development of Solana.

## inner instruction

See [cross-program invocation](#cross-program-invocation-cpi).

## instruction

A call to invoke a specific [instruction handler](#instruction-handler) in a
[program](#program). An instruction also specifies which accounts it wants to
read or modify, and additional data that serves as auxiliary input to the
[instruction handler](#instruction-handler). A [client](#client) must include at
least one instruction in a [transaction](#transaction), and all instructions
must complete for the transaction to be considered successful.

## instruction handler

Instruction handlers are [program](#program) functions that process
[instructions](#instruction) from [transactions](#transaction). An instruction
handler may contain one or more
[cross-program invocations](#cross-program-invocation-cpi).

## keypair

A [public key](#public-key-pubkey) and corresponding [private key](#private-key)
for accessing an account.

## lamport

A fractional [native token](#native-token) with the value of 0.000000001
[sol](#sol).

> Within the compute budget, a quantity of
> _[micro-lamports](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/ced8f6a512c61e0dd5308095ae8457add4a39e94/program-runtime/src/prioritization_fee.rs#L1-L2)_
> is used in the calculation of [prioritization fees](#prioritization-fee).

## leader

The role of a [validator](#validator) when it is appending [entries](#entry) to
the [ledger](#ledger).

## leader schedule

A sequence of [validator](#validator) [public keys](#public-key-pubkey) mapped
to [slots](#slot). The cluster uses the leader schedule to determine which
validator is the [leader](#leader) at any moment in time.

## ledger

A list of [entries](#entry) containing [transactions](#transaction) signed by
[clients](#client). Conceptually, this can be traced back to the
[genesis block](#genesis-block), but an actual [validator](#validator)'s ledger
may have only newer [blocks](#block) to reduce storage, as older ones are not
needed for validation of future blocks by design.

## ledger vote

A [hash](#hash) of the [validator's state](#bank-state) at a given
[tick height](#tick-height). It comprises a [validator's](#validator)
affirmation that a [block](#block) it has received has been verified, as well as
a promise not to vote for a conflicting [block](#block) \(i.e. [fork](#fork)\)
for a specific amount of time, the [lockout](#lockout) period.

## light client

A type of [client](#client) that can verify it's pointing to a valid
[cluster](#cluster). It performs more ledger verification than a
[thin client](#thin-client) and less than a [validator](#validator).

## loader

A [program](#program) with the ability to interpret the binary encoding of other
onchain programs.

## lockout

The duration of time for which a [validator](#validator) is unable to
[vote](#ledger-vote) on another [fork](#fork).

## message

The structured contents of a [transaction](#transaction). Generally containing a
header, array of account addresses, recent [blockhash](#blockhash), and an array
of [instructions](#instruction).

Learn more about the
[message formatting inside of transactions](/docs/core/transactions.md#message-header)
here.

## Nakamoto coefficient

A measure of decentralization, the Nakamoto Coefficient is the smallest number
of independent entities that can act collectively to shut down a blockchain. The
term was coined by Balaji S. Srinivasan and Leland Lee in
[Quantifying Decentralization](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e).

## native token

The [token](#token) used to track work done by [nodes](#node) in a cluster.

## node

A computer participating in a [cluster](#cluster).

## node count

The number of [validators](#validator) participating in a [cluster](#cluster).

## onchain program

The executable code on Solana blockchain that interprets the
[instructions](#instruction) sent inside of each [transaction](#transaction) to
read and modify accounts over which it has control. These programs are often
referred to as "[_smart contracts_](/docs/core/programs.md)" on other
blockchains.

## PoH

See [Proof of History](#proof-of-history-poh).

## point

A weighted [credit](#credit) in a rewards regime. In the [validator](#validator)
[rewards regime](https://docs.anza.xyz/consensus/stake-delegation-and-rewards),
the number of points owed to a [stake](#stake) during redemption is the product
of the [vote credits](#vote-credit) earned and the number of lamports staked.

## private key

The private key of a [keypair](#keypair).

## program

See [onchain program](#onchain-program).

## program derived account (PDA)

An account whose signing authority is a program and thus is not controlled by a
private key like other accounts.

## program id

The public key of the [account](#account) containing a [program](#program).

## proof of history (PoH)

A stack of proofs, each of which proves that some data existed before the proof
was created and that a precise duration of time passed before the previous
proof. Like a [VDF](#verifiable-delay-function-vdf), a Proof of History can be
verified in less time than it took to produce.

## prioritization fee

An additional fee user can specify in the compute budget
[instruction](#instruction) to prioritize their [transactions](#transaction).

The prioritization fee is calculated by multiplying the requested maximum
compute units by the compute-unit price (specified in increments of 0.000001
lamports per compute unit) rounded up to the nearest lamport.

Transactions should request the minimum amount of compute units required for
execution to minimize fees.

## public key (pubkey)

The public key of a [keypair](#keypair).

## rent

Fee paid by [Accounts](#account) and [Programs](#program) to store data on the
blockchain. When accounts do not have enough balance to pay rent, they may be
Garbage Collected.

See also [rent exempt](#rent-exempt) below. Learn more about rent here:
[What is rent?](/docs/intro/rent.md).

## rent exempt

Accounts that maintain a minimum lamport balance that is proportional to the
amount of data stored on the account. All newly created accounts are stored
on-chain permanently until the account is closed. It is not possible to create
an account that falls below the rent exemption threshold.

## root

A [block](#block) or [slot](#slot) that has reached maximum [lockout](#lockout)
on a [validator](#validator). The root is the highest block that is an ancestor
of all active forks on a validator. All ancestor blocks of a root are also
transitively a root. Blocks that are not an ancestor and not a descendant of the
root are excluded from consideration for consensus and can be discarded.

## runtime

The component of a [validator](#validator) responsible for [program](#program)
execution.

## Sealevel

Solana's parallel run-time for [onchain programs](#onchain-program).

## shred

A fraction of a [block](#block); the smallest unit sent between
[validators](#validator).

## signature

A 64-byte ed25519 signature of R (32-bytes) and S (32-bytes). With the
requirement that R is a packed Edwards point not of small order and S is a
scalar in the range of `0 <= S < L`. This requirement ensures no signature
malleability. Each transaction must have at least one signature for
[fee account](#fee-account). Thus, the first signature in transaction can be
treated as [transaction id](#transaction-id)

## skip rate

The percentage of [skipped slots](#skipped-slot) out of the total leader slots
in the current epoch. This metric can be misleading as it has high variance
after the epoch boundary when the sample size is small, as well as for
validators with a low number of leader slots, however can also be useful in
identifying node misconfigurations at times.

## skipped slot

A past [slot](#slot) that did not produce a [block](#block), because the leader
was offline or the [fork](#fork) containing the slot was abandoned for a better
alternative by cluster consensus. A skipped slot will not appear as an ancestor
for blocks at subsequent slots, nor increment the [block height](#block-height),
nor expire the oldest `recent_blockhash`.

Whether a slot has been skipped can only be determined when it becomes older
than the latest [rooted](#root) (thus not-skipped) slot.

## slot

The period of time for which each [leader](#leader) ingests transactions and
produces a [block](#block).

Collectively, slots create a logical clock. Slots are ordered sequentially and
non-overlapping, comprising roughly equal real-world time as per
[PoH](#proof-of-history-poh).

## smart contract

See [onchain program](#onchain-program).

## SOL

The [native token](#native-token) of a Solana [cluster](#cluster).

## Solana Program Library (SPL)

behavior can be proven.

## stake-weighted quality of service (SWQoS)

SWQoS allows
[preferential treatment for transactions that come from staked validators](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/stake-weighted-qos).

## supermajority

2/3 of a [cluster](#cluster).

## sysvar

A system [account](#account). [Sysvars](https://docs.anza.xyz/runtime/sysvars)
provide cluster state information such as current tick height, rewards
[points](#point) values, etc. Programs can access Sysvars via a Sysvar account
(pubkey) or by querying via a syscall.

## thin client

A type of [client](#client) that trusts it is communicating with a valid
[cluster](#cluster).

## tick

A ledger [entry](#entry) that estimates wallclock duration.

## tick height

The Nth [tick](#tick) in the [ledger](#ledger).

## token

## Token Extensions Program

The [Token Extensions Program](https://spl.solana.com/token-2022) has the
program ID `TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb` and includes all the
same features as the [Token Program](#token-program), but comes with extensions
such as confidential transfers, custom transfer logic, extended metadata, and
much more.

## token mint

An account that can produce (or 'mint') tokens. Different tokens are
distinguished by their unique token mint addresses.

## Token Program

The [Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token) has the program ID
`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`, and provides the basic
capabilities of transferring, freezing, and minting tokens.

accepted onto the [ledger](#ledger). A transaction is finalized when its block
becomes a [root](#root).

## transactions entry

A set of [transactions](#transaction) that may be executed in parallel.

## tvu

[Transaction validation unit](https://docs.anza.xyz/validator/tvu).
