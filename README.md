# Solana Developer Content

This repo is the open source home of content for developers looking to learn and
develop on the Solana blockchain.

These markdown based content posts are gathered from contributors from around
the Solana ecosystem and displayed on
[solana.com/developers](solana.com/developers) for all to learn from.

## Structure

There are a few primary types of Solana Developer content within this repo:

- [`docs`](#solana-docs) - The [core documentation](https://solana.com/docs) for
  the Solana blockchain
- [`guides`](#developer-guides) - Long form tutorials focused on a specific
  topic related to Solana development, like building dApps and programs
- [`resources`](#developer-resources) - Collection of the popular frameworks,
  sdks, documentation sites, and developer tools from around the ecosystem

### Solana Docs

The core [Solana Documentation](https://solana.com/docs) is housed within this
repo, including the documentation for the
[Solana RPC methods](https://solana.com/docs/rpc).

#### Validator Docs

The "core documentation" within this repo is generalized to the Solana protocol
as a whole and not the specific implementations of any given Validator client.

If you are looking for the documentation of a specific Validator client's
implementation, consult their respective documentation:

### Developer Guides

The [Solana Developer guides](https://solana.com/developers/guides) teach new
and experienced developers how to build on Solana. They teach various
programming concepts on Solana and often dive into popular sdks and provide code
examples to build dApps.

Each developer guide is typically focused on a specific topic or concept.
