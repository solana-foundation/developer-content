# Solana Developer Content

This repo is the open source home of content for developers looking to learn and
develop on the Solana blockchain.

These markdown based content posts are gathered from contributors from around
the Solana ecosystem and displayed on
[solana.com/developers](https://solana.com/developers) for all to learn from.

## Structure

There are a few primary types of Solana Developer content within this repo:

- [`courses`](#cources) - multiple lessons comprehensively covering a given
  topic, with both a theory section and an interactive lab for each lesson
- [`docs`](#docs) - the [core documentation](https://solana.com/docs) for the
  Solana blockchain
- [`guides`](#developer-guides) - long form tutorials focused on a specific
  topic related to Solana development, like building dApps and programs
- [`resources`](#developer-resources) - collection of popular frameworks, SDKs,
  documentation sites, and developer tools from around the ecosystem

### Courses

### Docs

The core [Solana Documentation](https://solana.com/docs) is housed within this
repo, including the documentation for the
[Solana RPC methods](https://solana.com/docs/rpc).

#### Validator Docs

The "core documentation" within this repo is generalized to the Solana protocol
as a whole and not the specific implementations of any given Validator client.

For specific validator clients, consult their respective documentation:

| Validator Client         | Repo                                                               | Website                                                |

### Developer Guides

The [Solana Developer guides](https://solana.com/developers/guides) teach new
and experienced developers how to build on Solana. They teach various
programming concepts on Solana and often dive into popular SDKs and provide code
examples to build dApps.

Each developer guide is typically focused on a specific topic or concept.

### Developer Resources

The [Solana Developer resources](https://solana.com/developers/resources) within
this repo are meant to be a public directory of resources. Our goal is to help
anyone discover the various developer tools, sdks, tooling, and frameworks that
exist within the Solana ecosystem.

The developer resources within this directory are not normally maintained by the
same maintainers of this repo.

If you are having issues with a specific resource, content their maintainers. Do
not open an issue on this repo, unless to update, add, or remove a resource's
information within our directory.

If you are interested in submitting a new developer resource, please consult the
contributing guide section for
[Submitting a Resource](./CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-resource).
