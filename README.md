### Written in markdown

The various types of developer content records within this repo are written in
standard markdown files, with YAML frontmatter.

Each of the content records use the YAML frontmatter to store specific pieces of
metadata about the content. The specifically required YAML fields may be
slightly different between the content records groups (e.g. `guides`,
`resources`, `courses`, etc).

The specific list of required and optional frontmatter fields are viewable in
the [`contentlayer.config.ts`](./contentlayer.config.ts) file. And are enforced
via [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and GitHub actions.
