# Ship your first xNFT ⛴️

## 🎒 What even is an xNFT ?

First of all, the "X" in xNFT stands for eXecutable. So basically an xNFT is
an  
eXecutable NFT. But, where can it be executed?

That's where [Backpack](https://www.backpack.app/) comes in. Backpack is a multi
chain crypto wallet developed by a company named Coral founded by Armani
Ferrante, the creator of the Solana Anchor Framework. It can run apps called
xNFTs, and has their own app store. That means the property right for an app is
own-able as an NFT. If that didn't make sense, don't stress out, you're gonna be
able to try it out yourself.

## 🔧 Dependencies

To follow along in this workshop, you are going to need:
