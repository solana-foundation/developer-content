title: Program Architecture
objectives:
  - Use Box and Zero Copy to work with large data onchain
  - Make better PDA design decisions
  - Future-proof your programs
  - Deal with concurrency issues
description: "Design your Solana programs efficiently."

## Summary

- If your data accounts are too large for the Stack, wrap them in `Box` to
  allocate them to the Heap
- Use Zero-Copy to deal with accounts that are too large for `Box` (< 10MB)
- The size and the order of fields in an account matter; put the variable length
  fields at the end
- Solana can process in parallel, but you can still run into bottlenecks; be
  mindful of "shared" accounts that all users interacting with the program have
  to write to

## Lesson

Program Architecture is what separates the hobbyist from the professional.
Crafting performant programs has more to do with system **design** than it does
with the code. And you, as the designer, need to think about:

    1. What your code needs to do
    2. What possible implementations there are
    3. What are the tradeoffs between different implementations

These questions are even more important when developing for a blockchain. Not
only are resources more limited than in a typical computing environment, you're
also dealing with people's assets; code has a cost now.

We'll leave most of the asset handling discussion to
[security course lesson](/content/courses/program-security/security-intro), but
it's important to note the nature of resource limitations in Solana development.
There are, of course, limitations in a typical development environment, but
there are limitations unique to blockchain and Solana development such as how
much data can be stored in an account, the cost to store that data, and how many
compute units are available per transaction. You, the program designer, have to
be mindful of these limitations to create programs that are affordable, fast,
safe, and functional. Today we will be delving into some of the more advanced
considerations that should be taken when creating Solana programs.

### Dealing With Large Accounts

In modern application programming, we don't often have to think about the size
of the data structures we are using. Do you want to make a string? You can put a
4000-character limit on it if you want to avoid abuse, but it's probably not an
issue. Want an integer? They're pretty much always 32-bit for convenience.

In high-level languages, you are in the data-land-o-plenty! Now, in Solana land,
we pay per byte stored (rent) and have limits on heap, stack, and account sizes.
We have to be a little more crafty with our bytes. There are two main concerns
we are going to be looking at in this section:

1. Since we pay-per-byte, we generally want to keep our footprint as small as
   possible. We will delve more into optimization in another section, but we'll
   introduce you to the concept of data sizes here.

2. When operating on larger data, we run into
   [Stack](https://solana.com/docs/programs/faq#stack) and
   [Heap](https://solana.com/docs/programs/faq#heap-size) constraints - to get
   around these, we'll look at using Box and Zero-Copy.

#### Sizes

In Solana, a transaction's fee payer pays for each byte stored onchain. This is
called [rent](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#rent).

<Callout type="note">

Rent is a bit of a misnomer since it never gets permanently taken. Once you
deposit rent into the account, that data can stay there forever, or you can get
refunded the rent if you close the account. Rent used to be an actual thing, but
now there's an enforced minimum rent exemption. You can read about it in
[the Solana documentation](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#rent-exempt).</Callout>

Putting data on the blockchain can be expensive, which is why NFT attributes and
associated files, like images, are stored offchain. The goal is to strike a
balance between keeping your program highly functional and ensuring that users
aren't discouraged by the cost of storing data onchain.

The first step in optimizing for space in your program is understanding the size
of your structs. Below is a helpful reference from the
[Anchor Book](https://book.anchor-lang.com/anchor_references/space.html).

| Types       | Space in bytes                | Details/Example                                                                                 |

| Enum        | 1 + Largest Variant Size      | e.g. Enum \{ A, B \{ val: u8 \}, C \{ val: u16 \} \} -> 1 + space(u16) = 3                      |
| f32         | 4                             | serialization will fail for NaN                                                                 |
| f64         | 8                             | serialization will fail for NaN                                                                 |

Knowing these, start thinking about little optimizations you might take in a
program. For example, if you have an integer field that will only ever reach
100, don't use a u64/i64, use a u8. Why? Because a u64 takes up 8 bytes, with a
max value of 2^64 or 1.84 \* 10^19. That's a waste of space since you only need
to accommodate numbers up to 100. A single byte will give you a max value of 255
which, in this case, would be sufficient. Similarly, there's no reason to use i8
if you'll never have negative numbers.

Be careful with small number types, though. You can quickly run into unexpected
behavior due to overflow. For example, a u8 type that is iteratively incremented
will reach 255 and then go back to 0 instead of 256. For more real-world
context, look up the
**[Y2K bug](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/Y2K-bug/#:~:text=As%20the%20year%202000%20approached%2C%20computer%20programmers%20realized%20that%20computers,would%20be%20damaged%20or%20flawed.).**

[Sec3's blog post about it](https://www.sec3.dev/blog/all-about-anchor-account-size)
.

#### Box

Now that you know a little bit about data sizes, let's skip forward and look at
a problem you'll run into if you want to deal with larger data accounts. Say you
have the following data account:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct SomeBigDataStruct {
    pub big_data: [u8; 5000],
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SomeFunctionContext<'info> {
    pub some_big_data: Account<'info, SomeBigDataStruct>,
}
```

If you try to pass `SomeBigDataStruct` into the function with the
`SomeFunctionContext` context, you'll run into the following compiler warning:

`// Stack offset of XXXX exceeded max offset of 4096 by XXXX bytes, please minimize large stack variables`

And if you try to run the program it will just hang and fail.

Why is this?

It has to do with the Stack. Every time you call a function in Solana it gets a
4KB stack frame. This is static memory allocation for local variables. This is
where that entire `SomeBigDataStruct` gets stored in memory and since 5000
bytes, or 5KB, is greater than the 4KB limit, it will throw a stack error. So
how do we fix this?

The answer is the
[**`Box<T>`**](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/accounts/boxed/index.html)
type!

```rust
#[account]
pub struct SomeBigDataStruct {
    pub big_data: [u8; 5000],
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SomeFunctionContext<'info> {
    pub some_big_data: Box<Account<'info, SomeBigDataStruct>>, // <- Box Added!
}
```

In Anchor, **`Box<T>`** is used to allocate the account to the Heap, not the
Stack. Which is great since the Heap gives us 32KB to work with. The best part
is you don't have to do anything different within the function. All you need to
do is add `Box<…>` around all of your big data accounts.

But Box is not perfect. You can still overflow the stack with sufficiently large
accounts. We'll learn how to fix this in the next section.

#### Zero Copy

Okay, so now you can deal with medium-sized accounts using `Box`. But what if
you need to use really big accounts like the max size of 10MB? Take the
following as an example:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct SomeReallyBigDataStruct {
    pub really_big_data: [u128; 1024], // 16,384 bytes
}
```

This account will make your program fail, even wrapped in a `Box`. To get around
this, you can use `zero_copy` and `AccountLoader`. Simply add `zero_copy` to
your account struct, add `zero` as a constraint in the account validation
struct, and wrap the account type in the account validation struct in an
`AccountLoader`.

```rust
#[account(zero_copy)]
pub struct SomeReallyBigDataStruct {
    pub really_big_data: [u128; 1024], // 16,384 bytes
}

pub struct ConceptZeroCopy<'info> {
    #[account(zero)]
    pub some_really_big_data: AccountLoader<'info, SomeReallyBigDataStruct>,
}
```

**Note**: In older versions of anchor `< 0.28.0` you may have to use:
`zero_copy(unsafe))` (
[Thanks @0xk2\_](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course/issues/347)
for this find )

To understand what's happening here, take a look at the
[rust Anchor documentation](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/attr.account.html)

> Other than being more efficient, the most salient benefit [`zero_copy`]

Basically, your program never actually loads zero-copy account data into the
stack or heap. It instead gets pointer access to the raw data. The
`AccountLoader` ensures this doesn't change too much about how you interact with
the account from your code.

There are a couple of caveats using `zero_copy`. First, you cannot use the
`init` constraint in the account validation struct like you may be used to. This
is due to there being a CPI limit on accounts bigger than 10KB.

```rust
pub struct ConceptZeroCopy<'info> {
    #[account(zero, init)] // <- Can't do this
    pub some_really_big_data: AccountLoader<'info, SomeReallyBigDataStruct>,
}
```

Instead, your client has to create a large account and pay for its rent in a
separate instruction.

```typescript
const accountSize = 16_384 + 8;
const ix = anchor.web3.SystemProgram.createAccount({
  fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
  newAccountPubkey: someReallyBigData.publicKey,
  lamports:
    await program.provider.connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
      accountSize,
    ),
  space: accountSize,
  programId: program.programId,
});

const txHash = await program.methods
  .conceptZeroCopy()
  .accounts({
    owner: wallet.publicKey,
    someReallyBigData: someReallyBigData.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([someReallyBigData])
  .preInstructions([ix])
  .rpc();
```

The second caveat is that you'll have to call one of the following methods from
inside your rust instruction function to load the account:

- `load_init` when first initializing an account (this will ignore the missing
  account discriminator that gets added only after the user's instruction code)
- `load` when the account is not mutable
- `load_mut` when the account is mutable

For example, if you wanted to init and manipulate the `SomeReallyBigDataStruct`
from above, you'd call the following in the function

```rust
let some_really_big_data = &mut ctx.accounts.some_really_big_data.load_init()?;
```

After you do that, then you can treat the account like normal! Go ahead and
experiment with this in the code yourself to see everything in action!

For a better understanding of how this all works, Solana put together a really
nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_yU0IuJxc&feature=youtu.be) and
[code](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-zero-copy-example) explaining
Box and Zero-Copy in vanilla Solana.

### Dealing with Accounts

Now that you know the nuts and bolts of space consideration on Solana, let's
look at some higher-level considerations. In Solana, everything is an account,
so for the next couple sections, we'll look at some account architecture
concepts.

#### Data Order

This first consideration is fairly simple. As a rule of thumb, keep all variable
length fields at the end of the account. Take a look at the following:

```rust
#[account] // Anchor hides the account discriminator
pub struct BadState {
    pub flags: Vec<u8>, // 0x11, 0x22, 0x33 ...
    pub id: u32         // 0xDEAD_BEEF
}
```

The `flags` field is variable length. This makes looking up a specific account
by the `id` field very difficult, as an update to the data in `flags` changes
the location of `id` on the memory map.

To make this more clear, observe what this account's data looks like onchain
when `flags` has four items in the vector vs eight items. If you were to call
`solana account ACCOUNT_KEY` you'd get a data dump like the following:

```rust
0000:   74 e4 28 4e    d9 ec 31 0a  -> Account Discriminator (8)
0008: 04 00 00 00    11 22 33 44  -> Vec Size (4) | Data 4*(1)
0010:   DE AD BE EF                 -> id (4)

--- vs ---

0000:   74 e4 28 4e    d9 ec 31 0a  -> Account Discriminator (8)
0008: 08 00 00 00    11 22 33 44  -> Vec Size (8) | Data 4*(1)
0010:   55 66 77 88    DE AD BE EF  -> Data 4*(1) | id (4)
```

In both cases, the first eight bytes are the Anchor account discriminator. In
the first case, the next four bytes represent the size of the `flags` vector,
followed by another four bytes for the data, and finally the `id` field's data.

In the second case, the `id` field moved from address 0x0010 to 0x0014 because
the data in the `flags` field took up four more bytes.

The main problem with this is lookup. When you query Solana, you use filters
that look at the raw data of an account. These are called a `memcmp` filters, or
memory compare filters. You give the filter an `offset` and `bytes`, and the
filter then looks directly at the memory, offset from the start by the `offset`
you provide, and compares the bytes in memory to the `bytes` you provide.

For example, you know that the `flags` struct will always start at the address
0x0008 since the first 8 bytes contain the account discriminator. Querying all
accounts where the `flags` length is equal to four is possible because we _know_
that the four bytes at 0x0008 represent the length of the data in `flags`. Since
the account discriminator is

```typescript
const states = await program.account.badState.all([
  {
    memcmp: {
      offset: 8,
      bytes: bs58.encode([0x04]),
    },
  },
]);
```

However, if you wanted to query by the `id`, you wouldn't know what to put for
the `offset` since the location of `id` is variable based on the length of
`flags`. That doesn't seem very helpful. IDs are usually there to help with
queries! The simple fix is to flip the order.

```rust
#[account] // Anchor hides the account discriminator
pub struct GoodState {
 pub id: u32         // 0xDEAD_BEEF
    pub flags: Vec<u8>, // 0x11, 0x22, 0x33 ...
}
```

With variable length fields at the end of the struct, you can always query
accounts based on all the fields up to the first variable length field. To echo
the beginning of this section: As a rule of thumb, keep all variable length
structs at the end of the account.

#### For Future Use

In certain cases, consider adding extra, unused bytes to your accounts. These
are held in reserve for flexibility and backward compatibility. Take the
following example:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct GameState {
    pub health: u64,
    pub mana: u64,
    pub event_log: Vec<string>
}
```

In this simple game state, a character has `health`, `mana`, and an event log.
If at some point you are making game improvements and want to add an
`experience` field, you'd hit a snag. The `experience` field should be a number
like a `u64`, which is simple enough to add. You can
[reallocate the account](/developers/courses/onchain-development/anchor-pdas)
and add space.

However, to keep dynamic length fields, like `event_log`, at the end of the
struct, you would need to do some memory manipulation on all reallocated
accounts to move the location of `event_log`. This can be complicated and makes
querying accounts far more difficult. You'll end up in a state where
non-migrated accounts have `event_log` in one location and migrated accounts in
another. The old `GameState` without `experience` and the new `GameState` with
`experience` in it are no longer compatible. Old accounts won't serialize when
used where new accounts are expected. Queries will be far more difficult. You'll
likely need to create a migration system and ongoing logic to maintain backward
compatibility. Ultimately, it begins to seem like a bad idea.

Fortunately, if you think ahead, you can add a `for_future_use` field that
reserves some bytes where you expect to need them most.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct GameState { //V1
    pub health: u64,
    pub mana: u64,
 pub for_future_use: [u8; 128],
    pub event_log: Vec<string>
}
```

That way, when you go to add `experience` or something similar, it looks like
this and both the old and new accounts are compatible.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct GameState { //V2
    pub health: u64,
    pub mana: u64,
 pub experience: u64,
 pub for_future_use: [u8; 120],
    pub event_log: Vec<string>
}
```

These extra bytes do add to the cost of using your program. However, it seems
well worth the benefit in most cases.

So as a general rule of thumb: anytime you think your account types have the
potential to change in a way that will require some kind of complex migration,
add in some `for_future_use` bytes.

#### Data Optimization

The idea here is to be aware of wasted bits. For example, if you have a field
that represents the month of the year, don't use a `u64`. There will only ever
be 12 months. Use a `u8`. Better yet, use a `u8` Enum and label the months.

To get even more aggressive on bit savings, be careful with booleans. Look at
the below struct composed of eight boolean flags. While a boolean _can_ be
represented as a single bit, borsh deserialization will allocate an entire byte
to each of these fields. That means that eight booleans wind up being eight
bytes instead of eight bits, an eight times increase in size.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct BadGameFlags { // 8 bytes
    pub is_frozen: bool,
    pub is_poisoned: bool,
    pub is_burning: bool,
    pub is_blessed: bool,
    pub is_cursed: bool,
    pub is_stunned: bool,
    pub is_slowed: bool,
    pub is_bleeding: bool,
}
```

To optimize this, you could have a single field as a `u8`. Then you can use
bitwise operations to look at each bit and determine if it's "toggled on" or
not.

```rust
const IS_FROZEN_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 0;
const IS_POISONED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 1;
const IS_BURNING_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 2;
const IS_BLESSED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 3;
const IS_CURSED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 4;
const IS_STUNNED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 5;
const IS_SLOWED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 6;
const IS_BLEEDING_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 7;
const NO_EFFECT_FLAG: u8 = 0b00000000;
#[account]
pub struct GoodGameFlags { // 1 byte
    pub status_flags: u8,
}
```

That saves you 7 bytes of data! The tradeoff, of course, is now you have to do
bitwise operations. But that's worth having in your toolkit.

#### Indexing

This last account concept is fun and illustrates the power of PDAs. When
creating program accounts, you can specify the seeds used to derive the PDA.
This is exceptionally powerful since it lets you derive your account addresses
rather than store them.

The best example of this is good ‘ol Associated Token Accounts (ATAs)!

```typescript
function findAssociatedTokenAddress(
  walletAddress: PublicKey,
  tokenMintAddress: PublicKey,
): PublicKey {
  return PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [
      walletAddress.toBuffer(),
      TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(),
      tokenMintAddress.toBuffer(),
    ],
    SPL_ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_ACCOUNT_PROGRAM_ID,
  )[0];
}
```

This is how most of your SPL tokens are stored. Rather than keep a database
table of SPL token account addresses, the only thing you have to know is your
wallet address and the mint address. The ATA address can be calculated by
hashing these together and viola! You have your token account address.

Depending on the seeding you can create all sorts of relationships:

- One-Per-Program (Global Account) - If you create an account with a determined
  `seeds=[b"ONE PER PROGRAM"]`, only one can ever exist for that seed in that
  program. For example, if your program needs a lookup table, you could seed it
  with `seeds=[b"Lookup"]`. Just be careful to provide appropriate access
  restrictions.
- One-Per-Owner - Say you're creating a video game player account and you only
  want one player account per wallet. Then you'd seed the account with
  `seeds=[b"PLAYER", owner.key().as_ref()]`. This way, you'll always know where
  to look for a wallet's player account **and** there can only ever be one of
  them.
- Multiple-Per-Owner - Okay, but what if you want multiple accounts per wallet?
  Say you want to mint podcast episodes. Then you could seed your `Podcast`
  account like this:
  `seeds=[b"Podcast", owner.key().as_ref(), episode_number.to_be_bytes().as_ref()]`.
  Now, if you want to look up episode 50 from a specific wallet, you can! And
  you can have as many episodes as you want per owner.
- One-Per-Owner-Per-Account - This is effectively the ATA example we saw above.
  Where we have one token account per wallet and mint account.
  `seeds=[b"Mock ATA", owner.key().as_ref(), mint.key().as_ref()]`

From there you can mix and match in all sorts of clever ways! But the preceding
list should give you enough to get started.

The big benefit of really paying attention to this aspect of design is answering
the ‘indexing' problem. Without PDAs and seeds, all users would have to keep
track of all of the addresses of all of the accounts they've ever used. This
isn't feasible for users, so they'd have to depend on a centralized entity to
store their addresses in a database. In many ways that defeats the purpose of a
globally distributed network. PDAs are a much better solution.

To drive this all home, here's an example of a scheme from a production
podcasting program. The program needed the following accounts:

- **Channel Account**
  - Name
  - Episodes Created (u64)
- **Podcast Account(s)**
  - Name
  - Audio URL

To properly index each account address, the accounts use the following seeds:

```rust
// Channel Account
seeds=[b"Channel", owner.key().as_ref()]

// Podcast Account
seeds=[b"Podcast", channel_account.key().as_ref(), episode_number.to_be_bytes().as_ref()]
```

You can always find the channel account for a particular owner. And since the
channel stores the number of episodes created, you always know the upper bound
of where to search for queries. Additionally, you always know what index to
create a new episode at: `index = episodes_created`.

```rust
Podcast 0: seeds=[b"Podcast", channel_account.key().as_ref(), 0.to_be_bytes().as_ref()]
Podcast 1: seeds=[b"Podcast", channel_account.key().as_ref(), 1.to_be_bytes().as_ref()]
Podcast 2: seeds=[b"Podcast", channel_account.key().as_ref(), 2.to_be_bytes().as_ref()]
...
Podcast X: seeds=[b"Podcast", channel_account.key().as_ref(), X.to_be_bytes().as_ref()]
```

### Dealing with Concurrency

One of the main reasons to choose Solana for your blockchain environment is its
parallel transaction execution. That is, Solana can run transactions in parallel
as long as those transactions aren't trying to write data to the same account.
This improves program throughput out of the box, but with some proper planning,
you can avoid concurrency issues and really boost your program's performance.

#### Shared Accounts

If you've been around crypto for a while, you may have experienced a big NFT
mint event. A new NFT project is coming out, everyone is really excited about
it, and then the candymachine goes live. It's a mad dash to click
`accept transaction` as fast as you can. If you were clever, you may have
written a bot to enter the transactions faster than the website's UI could. This
mad rush to mint creates a lot of failed transactions. But why? Because everyone
is trying to write data to the same Candy Machine account.

Take a look at a simple example:

Alice and Bob are trying to pay their friends Carol and Dean respectively. All
four accounts change, but neither depends on other. Both transactions can run at
the same time.

```rust
Alice -- pays --> Carol

Bob ---- pays --> Dean
```

But if Alice and Bob both try to pay Carol at the same time, they'll run into
issues.

```rust
Alice -- pays --> |
      -- > Carol
Bob   -- pays --- |
```

Since both of these transactions write to Carol's token account, only one of
them can go through at a time. Fortunately, Solana is wicked fast, so it'll
probably seem like they get paid at the same time. But what happens if more than
just Alice and Bob try to pay Carol?

```rust
Alice -- pays --> |
      -- > Carol
x1000 -- pays --- |
Bob   -- pays --- |
```

What if 1000 people try to pay Carol at the same time? Each of the 1000
instructions will be queued up to run in sequence. To some of them, the payment
will seem like it went through right away. They'll be the lucky ones whose
instruction got included early. But some of them will end up waiting quite a
bit. And for some, their transaction will simply fail.

While it seems unlikely for 1000 people to pay Carol at the same time, it's
actually very common to have an event, like an NFT mint, where many people are
trying to write data to the same account all at once.

Imagine you create a super popular program and you want to take a fee on every
transaction you process. For accounting reasons, you want all of those fees to
go to one wallet. With that setup, on a surge of users, your protocol will
become slow and or become unreliable. Not great. So what's the solution?
Separate the data transaction from the fee transaction.

For example, imagine you have a data account called `DonationTally`. Its only
function is to record how much you have donated to a specific hard-coded
community wallet.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct DonationTally {
    is_initialized: bool,
    lamports_donated: u64,
    lamports_to_redeem: u64,
    owner: Pubkey,
}
```

First, let's look at the suboptimal solution.

```rust
pub fn run_concept_shared_account_bottleneck(ctx: Context<ConceptSharedAccountBottleneck>, lamports_to_donate: u64) -> Result<()> {

    let donation_tally = &mut ctx.accounts.donation_tally;

    if !donation_tally.is_initialized {
        donation_tally.is_initialized = true;
        donation_tally.owner = ctx.accounts.owner.key();
        donation_tally.lamports_donated = 0;
        donation_tally.lamports_to_redeem = 0;
    }

    let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
        Transfer {
            from: ctx.accounts.owner.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.community_wallet.to_account_info(),
        });
    transfer(cpi_context, lamports_to_donate)?;


    donation_tally.lamports_donated = donation_tally.lamports_donated.checked_add(lamports_to_donate).unwrap();
    donation_tally.lamports_to_redeem = 0;

    Ok(())
}
```

You can see that the transfer to the hardcoded `community_wallet` happens in the
same function that you update the tally information. This is the most
straightforward solution, but if you run the tests for this section, you'll see
a slowdown.

Now look at the optimized solution:

```rust
pub fn run_concept_shared_account(ctx: Context<ConceptSharedAccount>, lamports_to_donate: u64) -> Result<()> {

    let donation_tally = &mut ctx.accounts.donation_tally;

    if !donation_tally.is_initialized {
        donation_tally.is_initialized = true;
        donation_tally.owner = ctx.accounts.owner.key();
        donation_tally.lamports_donated = 0;
        donation_tally.lamports_to_redeem = 0;
    }

    let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
        Transfer {
            from: ctx.accounts.owner.to_account_info(),
            to: donation_tally.to_account_info(),
        });
    transfer(cpi_context, lamports_to_donate)?;

    donation_tally.lamports_donated = donation_tally.lamports_donated.checked_add(lamports_to_donate).unwrap();
    donation_tally.lamports_to_redeem = donation_tally.lamports_to_redeem.checked_add(lamports_to_donate).unwrap();

    Ok(())
}

pub fn run_concept_shared_account_redeem(ctx: Context<ConceptSharedAccountRedeem>) -> Result<()> {
    let transfer_amount: u64 = ctx.accounts.donation_tally.lamports_donated;

    // Decrease balance in donation_tally account
    **ctx.accounts.donation_tally.to_account_info().try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= transfer_amount;

    // Increase balance in community_wallet account
    **ctx.accounts.community_wallet.to_account_info().try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += transfer_amount;

    // Reset lamports_donated and lamports_to_redeem
    ctx.accounts.donation_tally.lamports_to_redeem = 0;

    Ok(())
}
```

Here, in the `run_concept_shared_account` function, instead of transferring to
the bottleneck, we transfer to the `donation_tally` PDA. This way, we're only
effecting the donator's account and their PDA - so no bottleneck! Additionally,
we keep an internal tally of how many lamports need to be redeemed, ie be
transferred from the PDA to the community wallet at a later time. At some point
in the future, the community wallet will go around and clean up all the
straggling lamports (probably a good job for
[clockwork](https://www.clockwork.xyz/)). It's important to note that anyone
should be able to sign for the redeem function, since the PDA has permission
over itself.

If you want to avoid bottlenecks at all costs, this is one way to tackle them.
Ultimately this is a design decision and the simpler, less optimal solution
might be okay for some programs. But if your program is going to have high
traffic, it's worth trying to optimize. You can always run a simulation to see
your worst, best, and median cases.

### See it in Action

All of the code snippets from this lesson are part of a
[Solana program we created to illustrate these concepts](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/advanced-program-architecture.git).
Each concept has an accompanying program and test file. For example, the
**Sizes** concept can be found in:

**program -** `programs/architecture/src/concepts/sizes.rs`

**test -** `cd tests/sizes.ts`

Now that you've read about each of these concepts, feel free to jump into the
code to experiment a little. You can change existing values, try to break the
program, and generally try to understand how everything works.

You can fork and/or clone
[this program from Github](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/advanced-program-architecture.git)
to get started. Before building and running the test suite, remember to update
the `lib.rs` and `Anchor.toml` with your local program ID.

You can run the entire test suite or add `.only` to the `describe` call in a
specific test file to only run that file's tests. Feel free to customize it and
make it your own.

### Conclusion

We've talked about quite a few program architecture considerations: bytes,
accounts, bottlenecks, and more. Whether you wind up running into any of these
specific considerations or not, hopefully, the examples and discussion sparked
some thought. At the end of the day, you're the designer of your system. Your
job is to weigh the pros and cons of various solutions. Be forward-thinking, but
be practical. There is no "one good way" to design anything. Just know the
trade-offs.

## Lab

Let's use all of these concepts to create a simple, but optimized, RPG game
engine in Solana. This program will have the following features:

- Let users create a game (`Game` account) and become a "game master" (the
  authority over the game)
- Game masters are in charge of their game's configuration
- Anyone from the public can join a game as a player - each player/game
  combination will have a `Player` account
- Players can spawn and fight monsters (`Monster` account) by spending action
  points; we'll use lamports as the action points
- Spent action points go to a game's treasury as listed in the `Game` account

We'll walk through the tradeoffs of various design decisions as we go to give
you a sense of why we do things. Let's get started!

### 1. Program Setup

We'll build this from scratch. Start by creating a new Anchor project:

```bash
anchor init rpg
```

<Callout type="note">

This lab was created with Anchor version `0.30.1` in mind. If there are problems
compiling, please refer to the
[solution code](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/anchor-rpg/tree/main) for
the environment setup.</Callout>

Next, replace the program ID in `programs/rpg/lib.rs` and `Anchor.toml` with the
program ID shown when you run `anchor keys list`. Alternatively, you can run
command `anchor keys sync` that will automatically sync your program ID. This
command will sync the program ids between the program files(including
`Anchor.toml`) with the actual `pubkey` from the program keypair file.

Finally, let's scaffold out the program in the `lib.rs` file. Copy the following
into your file before we get started:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_lang::solana_program::log::sol_log_compute_units;

declare_id!("YOUR_KEY_HERE__YOUR_KEY_HERE");

#[program]
pub mod rpg {
    use super::*;

    pub fn create_game(ctx: Context<CreateGame>, max_items_per_player: u8) -> Result<()> {
        run_create_game(ctx, max_items_per_player)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn create_player(ctx: Context<CreatePlayer>) -> Result<()> {
        run_create_player(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn spawn_monster(ctx: Context<SpawnMonster>) -> Result<()> {
        run_spawn_monster(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn attack_monster(ctx: Context<AttackMonster>) -> Result<()> {
        run_attack_monster(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn deposit_action_points(ctx: Context<CollectActionPoints>) -> Result<()> {
        run_collect_action_points(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### 2. Create Account Structures

Now that our initial setup is ready, let's create our accounts. We'll have 3:

1. `Game` - This account represents and manages a game. It includes the treasury
   for game participants to pay into and a configuration struct that game
   masters can use to customize the game. It should include the following
   fields:
   - `game_master` - effectively the owner/authority
   - `treasury` - the treasury to which players will send action points (we'll
     just be using lamports for action points)
   - `action_points_collected` - tracks the number of action points collected by
     the treasury
   - `game_config` - a config struct for customizing the game
2. `Player` - A PDA account whose address is derived using the game account
   address and the player's wallet address as seeds. It has a lot of fields
   needed to track the player's game state:
   - `player` - the player's public key
   - `game` - the address of the corresponding game account
   - `action_points_spent` - the number of action points spent
   - `action_points_to_be_collected` - the number of action points that still
     need to be collected
   - `status_flag` - the player's status
   - `experience` - the player's experience
   - `kills` - number of monsters killed
   - `next_monster_index` - the index of the next monster to face
   - `for_future_use` - 256 bytes reserved for future use
   - `inventory` - a vector of the player's inventory
3. `Monster` - A PDA account whose address is derived using the game account
   address, the player's wallet address, and an index (the one stored as
   `next_monster_index` in the `Player` account).
   - `player` - the player the monster is facing
   - `game` - the game the monster is associated with
   - `hitpoints` - how many hit points the monster has left

This is the final project structure:

```bash
src/
├── constants.rs              # Constants used throughout the program
├── error/                    # Error module
│   ├── errors.rs             # Custom error definitions
│   └── mod.rs                # Module declarations for error handling
├── helpers.rs                # Helper functions used across the program
├── instructions/             # Instruction handlers for different game actions

│   ├── create_game.rs        # Handles game creation
│   ├── create_player.rs      # Handles player creation
│   ├── mod.rs                # Module declarations for instructions
│   └── spawn_monster.rs      # Handles spawning a new monster
├── lib.rs                    # Main entry point for the program
└── state/                    # State module for game data structures
    ├── game.rs               # Game state representation
    ├── mod.rs                # Module declarations for state
    ├── monster.rs            # Monster state representation
    └── player.rs             # Player state representation
```

When added to the program, the accounts should look like this:

```rust
// ----------- ACCOUNTS ----------

// Inside `state/game.rs`
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Game {
    pub game_master: Pubkey,
    pub treasury: Pubkey,
    pub action_points_collected: u64,
    pub game_config: GameConfig,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, InitSpace)]
pub struct GameConfig {
    pub max_items_per_player: u8,
    pub for_future_use: [u64; 16], // Health of Enemies? Experience per item? Action Points per Action?
}

// Inside `state/player.rs`
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Player { // 8 bytes
    pub player: Pubkey,                 // 32 bytes
    pub game: Pubkey,                   // 32 bytes

    pub action_points_spent: u64,               // 8 bytes
    pub action_points_to_be_collected: u64,     // 8 bytes

    pub status_flag: u8,                // 8 bytes
    pub experience: u64,                 // 8 bytes
    pub kills: u64,                     // 8 bytes
    pub next_monster_index: u64,        // 8 bytes

    pub for_future_use: [u8; 256],      // Attack/Speed/Defense/Health/Mana?? Metadata??

    pub inventory: Vec<InventoryItem>,  // Max 8 items
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, InitSpace)]
pub struct InventoryItem {
    pub name: [u8; 32], // Fixed Name up to 32 bytes
    pub amount: u64,
    pub for_future_use: [u8; 128], // Metadata? Effects? Flags?
}


// Inside `state/monster.rs`
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Monster {
    pub player: Pubkey,
    pub game: Pubkey,
    pub hitpoints: u64,
}
```

There aren't a lot of complicated design decisions here, but let's talk about
the `inventory` and `for_future_use` fields on the `Player` struct. Since
`inventory` is variable in length we decided to place it at the end of the
account to make querying easier. We've also decided it's worth spending a little
extra money on rent exemption to have 256 bytes of reserved space in the
`for_future_use` field. We could exclude this and simply reallocate accounts if
we need to add fields in the future, but adding it now simplifies things for us
in the future.

If we chose to reallocate in the future, we'd need to write more complicated
queries and likely couldn't query in a single call based on `inventory`.
Reallocating and adding a field would move the memory position of `inventory`,
leaving us to write complex logic to query accounts with various structures.

### 3. Create Ancillary Types

The next thing we need to do is add some of the types our accounts reference
that we haven't created yet.

Let's start with the game config struct. Technically, this could have gone in
the `Game` account, but it's nice to have some separation and encapsulation.
This struct should store the max items allowed per player and some bytes for
future use. Again, the bytes for future use here help us avoid complexity in the
future. Reallocating accounts works best when you're adding fields at the end of
an account rather than in the middle. If you anticipate adding fields in the
middle of an existing data, it might make sense to add some "future use" bytes
up front.

```rust filename="game.rs"
// ----------- GAME CONFIG ----------
// Inside `state/game.rs`
#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, InitSpace)]
pub struct GameConfig {
    pub max_items_per_player: u8,
    pub for_future_use: [u64; 16], // Health of Enemies? Experience per item? Action Points per Action?
}
```

Next, let's create our status flags. Remember, we _could_ store our flags as
booleans but we save space by storing multiple flags in a single byte. Each flag
takes up a different bit within the byte. We can use the `<<` operator to place
`1` in the correct bit.

```rust filename="constants.rs"
// ----------- STATUS ----------

pub const IS_FROZEN_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 0;
pub const IS_POISONED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 1;
pub const IS_BURNING_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 2;
pub const IS_BLESSED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 3;
pub const IS_CURSED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 4;
pub const IS_STUNNED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 5;
pub const IS_SLOWED_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 6;
pub const IS_BLEEDING_FLAG: u8 = 1 << 7;

pub const NO_EFFECT_FLAG: u8 = 0b00000000;
pub const ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR: usize = 8;
pub const MAX_INVENTORY_ITEMS: usize = 8;
```

Finally, let's create our `InventoryItem`. This should have fields for the
item's name, amount, and some bytes reserved for future use.

```rust filename="player.rs"
// ----------- INVENTORY ----------

// Inside `state/player.rs`
#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, InitSpace)]
pub struct InventoryItem {
    pub name: [u8; 32], // Fixed Name up to 32 bytes
    pub amount: u64,
    pub for_future_use: [u8; 128], // Metadata? Effects? Flags?
}

```

### 4. Create a helper function for spending action points

The last thing we'll do before writing the program's instructions is create a
helper function for spending action points. Players will send action points
(lamports) to the game treasury as payment for performing actions in the game.

Since sending lamports to a treasury requires writing data to that treasury
account, we could easily end up with a performance bottleneck if many players
are trying to write to the same treasury concurrently (See
[Dealing With Concurrency](#dealing-with-concurrency)).

Instead, we'll send them to the player PDA account and create an instruction
that will send the lamports from that account to the treasury in one fell swoop.
This alleviates any concurrency issues since every player has their own account,
but also allows the program to retrieve those lamports at any time.

```rust filename="helper.rs"
// ----------- HELPER ----------

// Inside /src/helpers.rs
use anchor_lang::{prelude::*, system_program};

use crate::{error::RpgError, Player};

pub fn spend_action_points<'info>(
    action_points: u64,
    player_account: &mut Account<'info, Player>,
    player: &AccountInfo<'info>,
    system_program: &AccountInfo<'info>,
) -> Result<()> {
    player_account.action_points_spent = player_account
        .action_points_spent
        .checked_add(action_points)
        .ok_or(error!(RpgError::ArithmeticOverflow))?;

    player_account.action_points_to_be_collected = player_account
        .action_points_to_be_collected
        .checked_add(action_points)
        .ok_or(error!(RpgError::ArithmeticOverflow))?;

    system_program::transfer(
        CpiContext::new(
            system_program.to_account_info(),
            system_program::Transfer {
                from: player.to_account_info(),
                to: player_account.to_account_info(),
            },
        ),
        action_points,
    )?;

    msg!("Minus {} action points", action_points);

    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. Create Game

Our first instruction will create the `game` account. Anyone can be a
`game_master` and create their own game, but once a game has been created there
are certain constraints.

For one, the `game` account is a PDA using its `treasury` wallet. This ensures
that the same `game_master` can run multiple games if they use a different
treasury for each.

<Callout>

The `treasury` is a signer on the instruction. This is to make sure whoever is
creating the game has the private keys to the `treasury`. This is a design
decision rather than "the right way." Ultimately, it's a security measure to
ensure the game master will be able to retrieve their funds. </Callout>

```rust filename="create_game.rs"
// ----------- CREATE GAME ----------

// Inside src/instructions/create_game.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

use crate::{error::RpgError, Game, ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR};

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateGame<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"GAME", treasury.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = game_master,
        space = ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR + Game::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub game: Account<'info, Game>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub game_master: Signer<'info>,
    pub treasury: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

pub fn run_create_game(ctx: Context<CreateGame>, max_items_per_player: u8) -> Result<()> {
    if max_items_per_player == 0 {
        return Err(error!(RpgError::InvalidGameConfig));
    }

    let game = &mut ctx.accounts.game;
    game.game_master = ctx.accounts.game_master.key();
    game.treasury = ctx.accounts.treasury.key();
    game.action_points_collected = 0;
    game.game_config.max_items_per_player = max_items_per_player;

    msg!("Game created!");
    Ok(())
}
```

### 6. Create Player

Our second instruction will create the `player` account. There are three
tradeoffs to note about this instruction:

1. The player account is a PDA account derived using the `game` and `player`
   wallet. This let's players participate in multiple games but only have one
   player account per game.
2. We wrap the `game` account in a `Box` to place it on the heap, ensuring we
   don't max out the Stack.
3. The first action any player makes is spawning themselves in, so we call
   `spend_action_points`. Right now we hardcode `action_points_to_spend` to be
   100 lamports, but this could be something added to the game config in the
   future.

```rust filename="create_player.rs"
// ----------- CREATE PLAYER ----------

// Inside src/instructions/create_player.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

use crate::{
    error::RpgError, helpers::spend_action_points, Game, Player, ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR,
    CREATE_PLAYER_ACTION_POINTS, NO_EFFECT_FLAG,
};

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreatePlayer<'info> {
    pub game: Box<Account<'info, Game>>,
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [
            b"PLAYER",
            game.key().as_ref(),
            player.key().as_ref()
        ],
        bump,
        payer = player,
        space = ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR + Player::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub player_account: Account<'info, Player>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

pub fn run_create_player(ctx: Context<CreatePlayer>) -> Result<()> {
    let player_account = &mut ctx.accounts.player_account;
    player_account.player = ctx.accounts.player.key();
    player_account.game = ctx.accounts.game.key();
    player_account.status_flag = NO_EFFECT_FLAG;
    player_account.experience = 0;
    player_account.kills = 0;

    msg!("Hero has entered the game!");

    // Spend 100 lamports to create player
    let action_points_to_spend = CREATE_PLAYER_ACTION_POINTS;

    spend_action_points(
        action_points_to_spend,
        player_account,
        &ctx.accounts.player.to_account_info(),
        &ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
    )
    .map_err(|_| error!(RpgError::InsufficientActionPoints))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### 7. Spawn Monster

Now that we have a way to create players, we need a way to spawn monsters for
them to fight. This instruction will create a new `Monster` account whose
address is a PDA derived from the `game` account, `player` account, and an index
representing the number of monsters the player has faced. There are two design
decisions here we should talk about:

1. The PDA seeds let us keep track of all the monsters a player has spawned
2. We wrap both the `game` and `player` accounts in `Box` to allocate them to
   the Heap

```rust filename="spawn_monster.rs"
// ----------- SPAWN MONSTER ----------

// Inside src/instructions/spawn_monster.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

use crate::{helpers::spend_action_points, Game, Monster, Player, SPAWN_MONSTER_ACTION_POINTS, ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR};

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SpawnMonster<'info> {
    pub game: Box<Account<'info, Game>>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        has_one = game,
        has_one = player,
    )]
    pub player_account: Box<Account<'info, Player>>,
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [
            b"MONSTER",
            game.key().as_ref(),
            player.key().as_ref(),
            player_account.next_monster_index.to_le_bytes().as_ref()
        ],
        bump,
        payer = player,
        space = ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR + Monster::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub monster: Account<'info, Monster>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

pub fn run_spawn_monster(ctx: Context<SpawnMonster>) -> Result<()> {
    let monster = &mut ctx.accounts.monster;
    monster.player = ctx.accounts.player.key();
    monster.game = ctx.accounts.game.key();
    monster.hitpoints = 100;

    let player_account = &mut ctx.accounts.player_account;
    player_account.next_monster_index = player_account.next_monster_index.checked_add(1).unwrap();

    msg!("Monster Spawned!");

    // Spend 5 lamports to spawn monster
    let action_point_to_spend = SPAWN_MONSTER_ACTION_POINTS;
    spend_action_points(
        action_point_to_spend,
        player_account,
        &ctx.accounts.player.to_account_info(),
        &ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### 8. Attack Monster

Now! Let's attack those monsters and start gaining some exp!

The logic here is as follows:

- Players spend 1 `action_point` to attack and gain 1 `experience`
- If the player kills the monster, their `kill` count goes up

As far as design decisions, we've wrapped each of the rpg accounts in `Box` to
allocate them to the Heap. Additionally, we've used `saturating_add` when
incrementing experience and kill counts.

The `saturating_add` function ensures the number will never overflow. Say the
`kills` was a u8 and my current kill count was 255 (0xFF). If I killed another
and added normally, e.g. `255 + 1 = 0 (0xFF + 0x01 = 0x00) = 0`, the kill count
would end up as 0. `saturating_add` will keep it at its max if it's about to
roll over, so `255 + 1 = 255`. The `checked_add` function will throw an error if
it's about to overflow. Keep this in mind when doing math in Rust. Even though
`kills` is a u64 and will never roll with it's current programming, it's good
practice to use safe math and consider roll-overs.

```rust filename="attack_monster.rs"
// ----------- ATTACK MONSTER ----------

// Inside src/instructions/attack_monster.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use crate::{helpers::spend_action_points, Monster, Player, ATTACK_ACTION_POINTS, error::RpgError};

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct AttackMonster<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        has_one = player,
    )]
    pub player_account: Box<Account<'info, Player>>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        has_one = player,
        constraint = monster.game == player_account.game @ RpgError::GameMismatch
    )]
    pub monster: Box<Account<'info, Monster>>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

pub fn run_attack_monster(ctx: Context<AttackMonster>) -> Result<()> {
    let player_account = &mut ctx.accounts.player_account;
    let monster = &mut ctx.accounts.monster;

    let hp_before_attack = monster.hitpoints;
    let hp_after_attack = monster.hitpoints.saturating_sub(1);
    let damage_dealt = hp_before_attack.saturating_sub(hp_after_attack);
    monster.hitpoints = hp_after_attack;

    if damage_dealt > 0 {
        msg!("Damage Dealt: {}", damage_dealt);
        player_account.experience = player_account.experience.saturating_add(1);
        msg!("+1 EXP");

        if hp_after_attack == 0 {
            player_account.kills = player_account.kills.saturating_add(1);
            msg!("You killed the monster!");
        }
    } else {
        msg!("Stop it's already dead!");
    }

    // Spend 1 lamport to attack monster
    let action_point_to_spend = ATTACK_ACTION_POINTS;

    spend_action_points(
        action_point_to_spend,
        player_account,
        &ctx.accounts.player.to_account_info(),
        &ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info()
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### 9. Redeem to Treasury

This is our last instruction. This instruction lets anyone send the spent
`action_points` to the `treasury` wallet.

Again, let's box the rpg accounts and use safe math.

```rust filename="collect_points.rs"
// ----------- REDEEM TO TREASUREY ----------

// Inside src/instructions/collect_points.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use crate::{error::RpgError, Game, Player};

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CollectActionPoints<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        has_one = treasury @ RpgError::InvalidTreasury
    )]
    pub game: Box<Account<'info, Game>>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        has_one = game @ RpgError::PlayerGameMismatch
    )]
    pub player: Box<Account<'info, Player>>,
    #[account(mut)]
    /// CHECK: It's being checked in the game account
    pub treasury: UncheckedAccount<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

// Literally anyone who pays for the TX fee can run this command - give it to a clockwork bot
pub fn run_collect_action_points(ctx: Context<CollectActionPoints>) -> Result<()> {
    let transfer_amount = ctx.accounts.player.action_points_to_be_collected;

    // Transfer lamports from player to treasury
    let player_info = ctx.accounts.player.to_account_info();
    let treasury_info = ctx.accounts.treasury.to_account_info();

    **player_info.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? = player_info
        .lamports()
        .checked_sub(transfer_amount)
        .ok_or(RpgError::InsufficientFunds)?;

    **treasury_info.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? = treasury_info
        .lamports()
        .checked_add(transfer_amount)
        .ok_or(RpgError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;

    ctx.accounts.player.action_points_to_be_collected = 0;

    ctx.accounts.game.action_points_collected = ctx.accounts.game
        .action_points_collected
        .checked_add(transfer_amount)
        .ok_or(RpgError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;

    msg!("The treasury collected {} action points", transfer_amount);

    Ok(())
}
```

### 10. Error Handling

Now, let's add all the errors that we have used till now in `errors.rs` file.

```rust filename="errors.rs"
// ------------RPG ERRORS--------------

// Inside src/error/errors.rs

use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#[error_code]
pub enum RpgError {
    #[msg("Arithmetic overflow occurred")]
    ArithmeticOverflow,
    #[msg("Invalid game configuration")]
    InvalidGameConfig,
    #[msg("Player not found")]
    PlayerNotFound,
    #[msg("Monster not found")]
    MonsterNotFound,
    #[msg("Insufficient action points")]
    InsufficientActionPoints,
    #[msg("Invalid attack")]
    InvalidAttack,
    #[msg("Maximum inventory size reached")]
    MaxInventoryReached,
    #[msg("Invalid item operation")]
    InvalidItemOperation,
    #[msg("Monster and player are not in the same game")]
    GameMismatch,
    #[msg("Invalid treasury account")]
    InvalidTreasury,
    #[msg("Player does not belong to the specified game")]
    PlayerGameMismatch,
    #[msg("Insufficient funds for transfer")]
    InsufficientFunds
}
```

### 11. Module Declarations

We need to declare all the modules used in the project as follows:

```rust

// Inside src/error/mod.rs
pub mod errors;
pub use errors::RpgError;   // Expose the custom error type

// Inside src/instructions/mod.rs
pub mod attack_monster;
pub mod collect_points;
pub mod create_game;
pub mod create_player;
pub mod spawn_monster;

pub use attack_monster::*;   // Expose attack_monster functions
pub use collect_points::*;    // Expose collect_points functions
pub use create_game::*;       // Expose create_game functions
pub use create_player::*;     // Expose create_player functions
pub use spawn_monster::*;     // Expose spawn_monster functions

// Inside src/state/mod.rs
pub mod game;
pub mod monster;
pub mod player;

pub use game::*;      // Expose game state
pub use monster::*;   // Expose monster state
pub use player::*;    // Expose player state
```

### 12. Putting it all Together

Now that all of our instruction logic is written, let's add these functions to
actual instructions in the program. It can also be helpful to log compute units
for each instruction.

```rust filename="lib.rs"

// Insider src/lib.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_lang::solana_program::log::sol_log_compute_units;

mod state;
mod instructions;
mod constants;
mod helpers;
mod error;

use state::*;
use constants::*;
use instructions::*;

declare_id!("5Sc3gJv4tvPiFzE75boYMJabbNRs44zRhtT23fLdKewz");

#[program]
pub mod rpg {
    use super::*;

    pub fn create_game(ctx: Context<CreateGame>, max_items_per_player: u8) -> Result<()> {
        run_create_game(ctx, max_items_per_player)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn create_player(ctx: Context<CreatePlayer>) -> Result<()> {
        run_create_player(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn spawn_monster(ctx: Context<SpawnMonster>) -> Result<()> {
        run_spawn_monster(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn attack_monster(ctx: Context<AttackMonster>) -> Result<()> {
        run_attack_monster(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn deposit_action_points(ctx: Context<CollectActionPoints>) -> Result<()> {
        run_collect_action_points(ctx)?;
        sol_log_compute_units();
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

If you added in all of the sections correctly, you should be able to build
successfully.

```shell
anchor build
```

### Testing

Now, let's put everything together and see it in action!

We'll begin by setting up the `tests/rpg.ts` file. We will be writing each test
step by step. But before diving into the tests, we need to initialize a few
important accounts, specifically the `gameMaster` and the `treasury` accounts.

```typescript filename="rpg.ts"
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Rpg } from "../target/types/rpg";
import { assert } from "chai";
import {
  Keypair,
  LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
  PublicKey,
  TransactionSignature,
  TransactionConfirmationStrategy,
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import NodeWallet from "@coral-xyz/anchor/dist/cjs/nodewallet";

const GAME_SEED = "GAME";
const PLAYER_SEED = "PLAYER";
const MONSTER_SEED = "MONSTER";
const MAX_ITEMS_PER_PLAYER = 8;
const INITIAL_MONSTER_HITPOINTS = 100;
const AIRDROP_AMOUNT = 10 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
const CREATE_PLAYER_ACTION_POINTS = 100;
const SPAWN_MONSTER_ACTION_POINTS = 5;
const ATTACK_MONSTER_ACTION_POINTS = 1;
const MONSTER_INDEX_BYTE_LENGTH = 8;

const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
anchor.setProvider(provider);

const program = anchor.workspace.Rpg as Program<Rpg>;
const wallet = provider.wallet as NodeWallet;
const gameMaster = wallet;
const player = wallet;

const treasury = Keypair.generate();

const findProgramAddress = (seeds: Buffer[]): [PublicKey, number] =>
  PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(seeds, program.programId);

const confirmTransaction = async (
  signature: TransactionSignature,
  provider: anchor.Provider,
) => {
  const latestBlockhash = await provider.connection.getLatestBlockhash();
  const confirmationStrategy: TransactionConfirmationStrategy = {
    signature,
    blockhash: latestBlockhash.blockhash,
    lastValidBlockHeight: latestBlockhash.lastValidBlockHeight,
  };

  try {
    const confirmation =
      await provider.connection.confirmTransaction(confirmationStrategy);
    if (confirmation.value.err) {
      throw new Error(
        `Transaction failed: ${confirmation.value.err.toString()}`,
      );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Transaction confirmation failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
};

const createGameAddress = () =>
  findProgramAddress([Buffer.from(GAME_SEED), treasury.publicKey.toBuffer()]);

const createPlayerAddress = (gameAddress: PublicKey) =>
  findProgramAddress([
    Buffer.from(PLAYER_SEED),
    gameAddress.toBuffer(),
    player.publicKey.toBuffer(),
  ]);

const createMonsterAddress = (
  gameAddress: PublicKey,
  monsterIndex: anchor.BN,
) =>
  findProgramAddress([
    Buffer.from(MONSTER_SEED),
    gameAddress.toBuffer(),
    player.publicKey.toBuffer(),
    monsterIndex.toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", MONSTER_INDEX_BYTE_LENGTH),
  ]);

describe("RPG game", () => {
  it("creates a new game", async () => {});

  it("creates a new player", async () => {});

  it("spawns a monster", async () => {});

  it("attacks a monster", async () => {});

  it("deposits action points", async () => {});
});
```

Now lets add in the `creates a new game` test. Just call `createGame` with eight
items, be sure to pass in all the accounts, and make sure the `treasury` account
signs the transaction.

```typescript
it("creates a new game", async () => {
  try {
    const [gameAddress] = createGameAddress();

    const createGameSignature = await program.methods
      .createGame(MAX_ITEMS_PER_PLAYER)
      .accounts({
        game: gameAddress,
        gameMaster: gameMaster.publicKey,
        treasury: treasury.publicKey,
        systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .signers([treasury])
      .rpc();

    await confirmTransaction(createGameSignature, provider);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to create game: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

Go ahead and check that your test runs:

```typescript
yarn install
anchor test
```

**Hacky workaround:** If for some reason, the `yarn install` command results in
some `.pnp.*` files and no `node_modules`, you may want to call `rm -rf .pnp.*`
followed by `npm i` and then `yarn install`. That should work.

Now that everything is running, let's implement the `creates a new player`,
`spawns a monster`, and `attacks a monster` tests. Run each test as you complete
them to make sure things are running smoothly.

```typescript
it("creates a new player", async () => {
  try {
    const [gameAddress] = createGameAddress();
    const [playerAddress] = createPlayerAddress(gameAddress);

    const createPlayerSignature = await program.methods
      .createPlayer()
      .accounts({
        game: gameAddress,
        playerAccount: playerAddress,
        player: player.publicKey,
        systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .rpc();

    await confirmTransaction(createPlayerSignature, provider);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to create player: ${error.message}`);
  }
});

it("spawns a monster", async () => {
  try {
    const [gameAddress] = createGameAddress();
    const [playerAddress] = createPlayerAddress(gameAddress);

    const playerAccount = await program.account.player.fetch(playerAddress);
    const [monsterAddress] = createMonsterAddress(
      gameAddress,
      playerAccount.nextMonsterIndex,
    );

    const spawnMonsterSignature = await program.methods
      .spawnMonster()
      .accounts({
        game: gameAddress,
        playerAccount: playerAddress,
        monster: monsterAddress,
        player: player.publicKey,
        systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .rpc();

    await confirmTransaction(spawnMonsterSignature, provider);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to spawn monster: ${error.message}`);
  }
});

it("attacks a monster", async () => {
  try {
    const [gameAddress] = createGameAddress();
    const [playerAddress] = createPlayerAddress(gameAddress);

    const playerAccount = await program.account.player.fetch(playerAddress);
    const [monsterAddress] = createMonsterAddress(
      gameAddress,
      playerAccount.nextMonsterIndex.subn(1),
    );

    const attackMonsterSignature = await program.methods
      .attackMonster()
      .accounts({
        playerAccount: playerAddress,
        monster: monsterAddress,
        player: player.publicKey,
        systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .rpc();

    await confirmTransaction(attackMonsterSignature, provider);

    const monsterAccount = await program.account.monster.fetch(monsterAddress);
    assert(
      monsterAccount.hitpoints.eqn(INITIAL_MONSTER_HITPOINTS - 1),
      "Monster hitpoints should decrease by 1 after attack",
    );
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to attack monster: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

Notice the monster that we choose to attack is
`playerAccount.nextMonsterIndex.subn(1).toBuffer('le', 8)`. This allows us to
attack the most recent monster spawned. Anything below the `nextMonsterIndex`
should be okay. Lastly, since seeds are just an array of bytes we have to turn
the index into the u64, which is a little endian `le` at 8 bytes.

Run `anchor test` to deal some damage!

Finally, let's write a test to gather all the deposited action points. This test
may feel complex for what it's doing. That's because we're generating some new
accounts to show that anyone could call the redeem function
`depositActionPoints`. We use names like `clockwork` for these because if this
game were running continuously, it probably makes sense to use something like
[clockwork](https://www.clockwork.xyz/) cron jobs.

```typescript
it("deposits action points", async () => {
  try {
    const [gameAddress] = createGameAddress();
    const [playerAddress] = createPlayerAddress(gameAddress);

    // To show that anyone can deposit the action points
    // Ie, give this to a clockwork bot
    const clockworkWallet = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();

    // To give it a starting balance
    const clockworkProvider = new anchor.AnchorProvider(
      program.provider.connection,
      new NodeWallet(clockworkWallet),
      anchor.AnchorProvider.defaultOptions(),
    );

    // Have to give the accounts some lamports else the tx will fail
    const amountToInitialize = 10000000000;

    const clockworkAirdropTx =
      await clockworkProvider.connection.requestAirdrop(
        clockworkWallet.publicKey,
        amountToInitialize,
      );

    await confirmTransaction(clockworkAirdropTx, clockworkProvider);

    const treasuryAirdropTx = await clockworkProvider.connection.requestAirdrop(
      treasury.publicKey,
      amountToInitialize,
    );

    await confirmTransaction(treasuryAirdropTx, clockworkProvider);

    const depositActionPointsSignature = await program.methods
      .depositActionPoints()
      .accounts({
        game: gameAddress,
        player: playerAddress,
        treasury: treasury.publicKey,
        systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .rpc();

    await confirmTransaction(depositActionPointsSignature, provider);

    const expectedActionPoints =
      CREATE_PLAYER_ACTION_POINTS +
      SPAWN_MONSTER_ACTION_POINTS +
      ATTACK_MONSTER_ACTION_POINTS;
    const treasuryBalance = await provider.connection.getBalance(
      treasury.publicKey,
    );
    assert(
      treasuryBalance === AIRDROP_AMOUNT + expectedActionPoints,
      "Treasury balance should match expected action points",
    );

    const gameAccount = await program.account.game.fetch(gameAddress);
    assert(
      gameAccount.actionPointsCollected.eqn(expectedActionPoints),
      "Game action points collected should match expected",
    );

    const playerAccount = await program.account.player.fetch(playerAddress);
    assert(
      playerAccount.actionPointsSpent.eqn(expectedActionPoints),
      "Player action points spent should match expected",
    );
    assert(
      playerAccount.actionPointsToBeCollected.eqn(0),
      "Player should have no action points to be collected",
    );
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to deposit action points: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```

Finally, run `anchor test` to see everything working.

```bash

RPG game
    ✔ creates a new game (317ms)
    ✔ creates a new player (399ms)
    ✔ spawns a monster (411ms)
    ✔ attacks a monster (413ms)
    ✔ deposits action points (1232ms)
```

Congratulations! This was a lot to cover, but you now have a mini RPG game
engine. If things aren't quite working, go back through the lab and find where
you went wrong. If you need to, you can refer to the
[`main` branch of the solution code](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/anchor-rpg).

Be sure to put these concepts into practice in your own programs. Each little
optimization adds up!

## Challenge

Now it's your turn to practice independently. Go back through the lab code
looking for additional optimizations and/or expansions you can make. Think
through new systems and features you would add and how you would optimize them.

You can find some example modifications on the
[`challenge-solution` branch of the RPG repository](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/anchor-rpg/tree/challenge-solution).

Finally, go through one of your own programs and think about optimizations you
can make to improve memory management, storage size, and/or concurrency.
