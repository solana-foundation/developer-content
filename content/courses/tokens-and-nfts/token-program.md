# The token program

The token program is part of the Solana Program Library (SPL) and allows you to create and manage tokens that aren't the native SOL token. These tokens could be anything, like USDC or custom tokens.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
1. Create a new token mint
2. Create token accounts
3. Mint tokens
4. Transfer tokens between accounts

We'll be using the `@solana/spl-token` JavaScript library to interact with the token program.

To install the library, run:
```bash
npm install @solana/spl-token
```

## Step 1: Creating a token mint

A **token mint** defines the token itself (like USD Coin or any other token). This mint account stores details about the token like its supply and the authority that can mint more tokens.

### Example:

```javascript
const { createMint } = require('@solana/spl-token');

const tokenMint = await createMint(
  connection,       // Connection to the Solana network
  payer,            // The account paying for this transaction
  mintAuthority,    // Who can mint more tokens
  freezeAuthority,  // Who can freeze token accounts (can be null)
  decimals          // Decimal precision of the token
);

console.log("Token Mint Address:", tokenMint.toBase58());
```

This will create a new token and print the public key (address) of the token mint, which is the token's contract address (CA). You can use this address to find information about the token on the blockchain.

## Step 2: Creating a token account

A token account is required to hold tokens. Each account holds tokens of a specific mint and is owned by an account (like your wallet).

### Using getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount

While you can create a token account at any address, it's often more convenient to use Associated Token Accounts (ATAs). An ATA is a deterministic address derived from a user's wallet address and the token mint address.

Here's how to create or retrieve an ATA:

```javascript
const { getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount } = require('@solana/spl-token');

const associatedTokenAccount = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
  connection,   // Connection to the Solana network
  payer,        // The account paying for this transaction
  mint,         // The mint (token) for which to create an account
  owner         // The owner of the new account
);

console.log("Associated Token Account:", associatedTokenAccount.address.toBase58());
```

This function will:
1. Check if an Associated Token Account already exists for the given owner and mint.
2. If it exists, return the existing account.
3. If it doesn't exist, create a new Associated Token Account and return it.

Using ATAs has several advantages:
- Predictability: You can always derive the same address for a given wallet and token.
- Efficiency: You don't need to keep track of multiple token accounts for the same token.
- User-friendliness: Many wallet apps and programs expect users to use ATAs.

## Step 3: Minting tokens

After creating a mint and an account to hold tokens, you can mint (create) tokens and deposit them into the token account.

```javascript
const { mintTo } = require('@solana/spl-token');

const TOKENS_TO_MINT = 100;

const transactionSignature = await mintTo(
  connection,      // Connection to the Solana network
  payer,           // The account paying for this transaction
  mint,            // The token mint
  tokenAccount,    // The account where the minted tokens will go
  mintAuthority,   // The account authorized to mint tokens
  TOKENS_TO_MINT   // The number of tokens to mint (considering decimals)
);

console.log("Minting Transaction Signature:", transactionSignature);
```

This will mint the specified number of tokens and print the transaction signature, which serves as a receipt confirming that the transaction was successfully executed on the blockchain.

## Step 4: Transferring tokens

Tokens can be transferred between accounts. Both the sender and receiver must have token accounts for the token being transferred.

```javascript
const { transfer } = require('@solana/spl-token');

const TOKENS_TO_TRANSFER = 10;

const transactionSignature = await transfer(
  connection,      // Connection to the Solana network
  payer,           // The account paying for this transaction
  sourceAccount,   // Source token account (sending tokens)
  destinationAccount, // Destination token account (receiving tokens)
  owner,           // The owner of the source account
  TOKENS_TO_TRANSFER // The amount of tokens to transfer
);

console.log("Transfer Transaction Signature:", transactionSignature);
```

This will transfer the specified number of tokens and print the transaction signature.

Now you know how to create a token, create a token account, mint tokens, and transfer tokens. You can use these examples to create your own token and interact with it on Solana.
