title: Local Program Development
objectives:
  - Set up a local environment for Solana program development, with Solana CLI
    tools, Rust, and Anchor.
  - Ensure Anchor works out of the box with no errors or warnings.
description: "Setup a local development environment for building onchain programs."

## Summary

- To develop onchain programs locally, you need the **Solana CLI**, **Rust**,
  and (optional, but recommended) **Anchor**.
- You can use `anchor init` to create a new blank Anchor project.
- `anchor test` runs your tests and also builds your code.

## Lesson

This lesson is a guide to installing the tools required for developing onchain
programs. Let's install Solana CLI tools, the Rust SDK, and Anchor, and create a
test program to ensure that our setup works.

## Lab

### Extra steps for Windows users

> macOS and Linux users can skip this section. If you're on Windows, you can
> follow along with these extra steps.

Firstly, make sure you have Windows Terminal installed, otherwise you can
install Windows Terminal from the
[Microsoft store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701).

Then,
[install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
WSL provides a Linux environment that launches instantly when needed without
slowing down your computer.

Open Windows Terminal, start an 'Ubuntu' session and proceed with the rest of
these steps.

### Download Rust

First, install Rust by
[following the instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Download the Solana CLI tools

Next,
[download the Solana CLI tools](/docs/intro/installation.md#install-the-solana-cli):

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```

After installation, `solana -V` should display `solana-cli 1.18.x` (where `x`
can be any number).

### Running the Solana Test Validator

The Solana Test Validator is a local emulator for the Solana blockchain. It
provides developers with a private and controlled environment to build and test
Solana programs without needing to connect to a public testnet or mainnet.

To start the Solana Test Validator, run the following command:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

When running `solana-test-validator`, you should see output indicating that the
validator is working correctly. Below is an example of what the output should
look like:

```bash
$ solana-test-validator
--faucet-sol argument ignored, ledger already exists
Ledger location: test-ledger
Log: test-ledger/validator.log
⠴ Initializing...
Waiting for fees to stabilize 1...
Identity: J8yKZJa5NtcmCQqmBRC6Fe8X6AECo8Vc3d7L3dF9JPiM
Genesis Hash: FTPnCMDzTEthZxE6DvHbsWWv83F2hFe1GFvpVFBMUoys
Version: 1.18.22
Shred Version: 49491
Gossip Address: 127.0.0.1:1024
TPU Address: 127.0.0.1:1027
JSON RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8899
WebSocket PubSub URL: ws://127.0.0.1:8900
⠄ 00:00:25 | Processed Slot: 114 | Confirmed Slot: 114 | Finalized Slot: 82 | Full Snapshot Slot: - | Incremental Snapshot Slot: - | Transactions: 111 | ◎499.999445000
```

If you see this output, it means the Solana test validator is running correctly.
You should cancel the process by pressing CTRL + C, as you'll need to run the
anchor test command next.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the
[Solana Test Validator guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/solana-test-validator).

### Download Anchor

Finally, [download Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
```

you may need to install additional dependencies in Linux (or WSL):

```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get upgrade && \
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev libssl-dev
```

proceed...

```bash
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

After installation, `anchor -V` should display `anchor-cli 0.30.1`. For more
detailed information on Anchor, refer to
[The Anchor Book](https://book.anchor-lang.com).

### Verify your Anchor Installation

Create a temporary project with the default contents using Anchor and ensure it
compiles and runs:

```bash
anchor init temp-project
cd temp-project
anchor test
```

**The `anchor test` command should complete with no errors or warnings**.

**However you may encounter issues, and we'll fix them below:**

#### `package `solana-program

v1.18.12` cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.75.0 or newer` error

This error is due to incompatible versions of `solana-program` and `solana-cli`.
Run `cargo add solana-program@"=1.18.x"`, where `x` matches your version of
`solana-cli`. Then re-run `anchor test`.

#### Error: `Unable to read keypair file`

Add a keypair to `.config/solana/id.json`. You can either copy a keypair from an
`.env` file (just the array of numbers) into a file or use the command
`solana-keygen new --no-bip39-passphrase` to create a new keypair file. Then
re-run `anchor test`.

#### error: no such command: `build-sbf`

If you see this message, this error typically occurs because the relevant
binaries are not in your shell's PATH variable.

Run this command to add this folder to your shell, and also add this to your
`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file to make the change permanent.

```bash
export PATH=~"/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Unable to get latest blockhash. Test validator does not look started.

There's multiple versions of the 'tar' (tape archiver) command Solana used for
archiving. macOS comes with BSD tar, but Solana CLI wants the GNU version
installed.

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and use it to install GNU tar:

  ```bash
  # Install Homebrew; you can skip this step if you already have Homebrew installed
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  # Install GNU tar
  brew install gnu-tar
  ```

- Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc file to make the change permanent.

  ```bash
  export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin:$PATH
  ```

#### Error: `Your configured rpc port: 8899 is already in use`

If you are running `solana-test-validator`, you may encounter the error
`Error: Your configured rpc port: 8899 is already in use` when running
`anchor test`. To resolve this, stop the `solana-test-validator` before running
`anchor test`.

### All done?

Ensure `anchor test` completes successfully - with no warnings and no errors -
before continuing.
