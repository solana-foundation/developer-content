## Summary

- The `seeds` and `bump` constraints are used to initialize and validate PDA
  accounts in Anchor
- The `init_if_needed` constraint is used to conditionally initialize a new
  account
- The `realloc` constraint is used to reallocate space on an existing account
- The `close` constraint is used to close an account and refund its rent

## Lesson

In this lesson you'll learn how to work with PDAs, reallocate accounts, and
close accounts in Anchor.

Recall that Anchor programs separate instruction logic from account validation.
Account validation happens in structs that list the accounts needed for an
instruction. Each field in the struct represents an account, and you can
customize the validation using the `#[account(...)]` attribute macro.

In addition to validating accounts, some constraints can automate tasks that
would otherwise require repetitive code in our instructions. This lesson will
cover the `seeds`, `bump`, `realloc`, and `close` constraints to help you easily
handle PDAs, reallocate space, and close accounts.

### PDAs with Anchor

PDAs store data, at addressed specified by the onchain programmer, using a list
of seeds, a bump seed, and a program ID.

Anchor provides a convenient way to validate a PDA with the `seeds` and `bump`
constraints.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
struct ExampleAccounts {
  #[account(
    seeds = [b"example_seed"],
    bump
  )]
  pub pda_account: Account<'info, AccountType>,
}
```

During account validation, Anchor will use the specified seeds to derive a PDA
and check if the provided account matches the derived PDA.

When the `bump` constraint is included without specifying a specific bump,
Anchor will use the canonical bump (the first bump that results in a valid PDA,
with a value of 255). Typically, you should use the canonical bump.

You can also use other fields from within the struct as seeds, such as the
signer's public key.

You can also reference the deserialized instruction data if you add the
`#[instruction(...)]` attribute macro to the struct.

For example, the following example shows a list of accounts that include:

- `pda_account`
- `user`

The `pda_account` is constrained such that the seeds must be the string
"example_seed," the public key of `user`, and the string passed into the
instruction as `instruction_data`.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(instruction_data: String)]
pub struct Example<'info> {
    #[account(
        seeds = [
            b"example_seed",
            user.key().as_ref(),
            instruction_data.as_ref()
        ],
        bump
    )]
    pub pda_account: Account<'info, AccountType>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>
}
```

If the `pda_account` address provided by the client doesn't match the PDA
derived using the specified seeds and the canonical bump, then the account
validation will fail.

#### Use PDAs with the `init` constraint

You can combine the `seeds` and `bump` constraints with the `init` constraint to
initialize an account using a PDA.

Recall that the `init` constraint must be used with the `payer` and `space`
constraints to specify who pays for the account initialization and how much
space to allocate.

Additionally, you need to include `system_program` to handle the creation and
funding of the new account.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InitializePda<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"example_seed", user.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = user,
        space = DISCRIMINATOR + Accountype::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub pda_account: Account<'info, AccountType>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct AccountType {
    pub data: u64,
}

const DISCRIMINATOR: usize = 8;
```

When using `init` for non-PDA accounts, Anchor defaults to setting the owner of
the initialized account to be the program currently executing the instruction.

However, when using `init` in combination with `seeds` and `bump`, the owner
_must_ be the executing program. This is because initializing an account for the
PDA requires a signature that only the executing program can provide. In other
words, the signature verification for the initialization of the PDA account
would fail if the program ID used to derive the PDA did not match the program ID
of the executing program.

#### Seed inference

The account list for an instruction can get really long for some programs. To
simplify the client-side experience when invoking an Anchor program instruction,
we can turn on **seed inference**.

Seed inference adds information about PDA seeds to the IDL so that Anchor can
infer PDA seeds from existing call-site information. In the previous example,
the seeds are `b"example_seed"` and `user.key()`. The first is static and
therefore known, and the second is known because `user` is the transaction
signer.

If you use seed inference when building your program, then as long as you're
calling the program using Anchor, you don't need to explicitly derive and pass
in the PDA. Instead, the Anchor library will do it for you.

You can turn on seed inference in the `Anchor.toml` file with `seeds = true`
under `[features]`.

```
[features]
seeds = true
```

#### Use the `#[instruction(...)]` attribute macro

Let's briefly look at the `#[instruction(...)]` attribute macro before moving
on. When using `#[instruction(...)]`, the instruction data you provide in the
list of arguments must match and be in the same order as the instruction
arguments. You can omit unused arguments at the end of the list, but you must
include all arguments up until the last one you will be using.

For example, imagine an instruction has arguments `input_one`, `input_two`, and
`input_three`. If your account constraints need to reference `input_one` and
`input_three`, you need to list all three arguments in the `#[instruction(...)]`
attribute macro.

However, if your constraints only reference `input_one` and `input_two`, you can
omit `input_three`.

```rust
pub fn example_instruction(
    ctx: Context<Example>,
    input_one: String,
    input_two: String,
    input_three: String,
) -> Result<()> {
    ...
    Ok(())
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(input_one:String, input_two:String)]
pub struct Example<'info> {
    ...
}
```

Additionally, you will get an error if you list the inputs in the incorrect
order:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(input_two:String, input_one:String)]
pub struct Example<'info> {
    ...
}
```

### Init-if-needed

Anchor provides an `init_if_needed` constraint that can be used to initialize an
account if the account has not already been initialized.

This feature is gated behind a feature flag to make sure you are intentional
about using it. For security reasons, it's smart to avoid having one instruction
branch into multiple logic paths. And as the name suggests, `init_if_needed`
executes one of two possible code paths depending on the state of the account in
question.

When using `init_if_needed`, you need to make sure to properly protect your
program against re-initialization attacks. You need to include checks in your
code that check that the initialized account cannot be reset to its initial
settings after the first time it was initialized.

To use `init_if_needed`, you must first enable the feature in `Cargo.toml`.

```rust
[dependencies]
anchor-lang = { version = "0.30.1", features = ["init-if-needed"] }
```

Once you’ve enabled the feature, you can include the constraint in the
`#[account(…)]` attribute macro. The example below demonstrates using the
`init_if_needed` constraint to initialize a new associated token account if one
does not already exist.

```rust
#[program]
mod example {
    use super::*;
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(
        init_if_needed,
        payer = payer,
        associated_token::mint = mint,
        associated_token::authority = payer
    )]
    pub token_account: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub mint: Account<'info, Mint>,
     #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
    pub associated_token_program: Program<'info, AssociatedToken>,
    pub rent: Sysvar<'info, Rent>,
}
```

When the `initialize` instruction is invoked in the previous example, Anchor
will check if the `token_account` exists and initialize it if it does not. If it
already exists, then the instruction will continue without initializing the
account. Just as with the `init` constraint, you can use `init_if_needed` in
conjunction with `seeds` and `bump` if the account is a PDA.

### Realloc

The `realloc` constraint provides a simple way to reallocate space for existing
accounts.

The `realloc` constraint must be used in combination with the following
constraints:

- `mut` - the account must be set as mutable
- `realloc::payer` - the account to subtract or add lamports to depending on
  whether the reallocation is decreasing or increasing account space
- `realloc::zero` - boolean to specify if new memory should be zero initialized

As with `init`, you must include `system_program` as one of the accounts in the
account validation struct when using `realloc`.

Below is an example of reallocating space for an account that stores a `data`
field of type `String`.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(instruction_data: String)]
pub struct ReallocExample<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"example_seed", user.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        realloc = DISCRIMINATOR + STRING_SIZE_SPACE + instruction_data.len(),
        realloc::payer = user,
        realloc::zero = false,
    )]
    pub pda_account: Account<'info, AccountType>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct AccountType {
    pub data: String,
}

const DISCRIMINATOR: usize = 8;
const STRING_SIZE_SPACE: usize = 4;
```

The `realloc` constraint from the above example can be broken down as follows:

- the `DISCRIMINATOR` is `8`
- the `STRING_SIZE_SPACE` is `4` for the space required to store the length of
  the string. As required by BORSH serialization
- `instruction_data.len()` is the length of the string itself

> [BORSH](https://solanacookbook.com/guides/serialization.html) stands for
> _Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing_ and is used to
> efficiently and compactly serialize and deserialize data structures.

If the change in account data length is additive, lamports will be transferred
from the `realloc::payer` to the account to maintain rent exemption. Likewise,
if the change is subtractive, lamports will be transferred from the account back
to the `realloc::payer`.

The `realloc::zero` constraint ensures that any new memory allocated during
reallocation is set to zero. This should be set to true if you expect the memory
of an account to change size frequently. This way, you clear out any old data
that might otherwise remain.

### Close

The `close` constraint provides a simple and secure way to close an existing
account.

The `close` constraint marks the account as closed at the end of the
instruction’s execution by setting its discriminator to a _special value_ called
`CLOSED_ACCOUNT_DISCRIMINATOR` and sends its lamports to a specified account.
This _special value_ prevents the account from being reopened because any
attempt to reinitialize the account will fail the discriminator check.

The example below uses the `close` constraint to close the `data_account` and
sends the lamports allocated for rent to the `receiver` account.

```rust
pub fn close(ctx: Context<Close>) -> Result<()> {
    Ok(())
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Close<'info> {
    #[account(mut, close = receiver)]
    pub data_account: Account<'info, AccountType>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub receiver: Signer<'info>
}
```

## Lab

Let’s practice the concepts we’ve gone over in this lesson by creating a Movie
Review program using the Anchor framework.

This program will allow users to:

- Use a PDA to initialize a new movie review account to store the review
- Update the content of an existing movie review account
- Close an existing movie review account

<Steps>

### Create a new Anchor project

To begin, let’s create a new project using `anchor init`.

```bash
anchor init anchor-movie-review-program
```

Next, navigate to the `lib.rs` file within the `programs` folder and you should
see the following starter code.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod anchor_movie_review_program {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

Go ahead and remove the `initialize` instruction and `Initialize` type.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod anchor_movie_review_program {
    use super::*;

}
```

### MovieAccountState

First, let’s use the `#[account]` attribute macro to define the
`MovieAccountState` that will represent the data structure of the movie review
accounts. As a reminder, the `#[account]` attribute macro implements various
traits that help with serialization and deserialization of the account, set the
discriminator for the account, and set the owner of a new account as the program
ID defined in the `declare_id!` macro.

Within each movie review account, we’ll store the:

- `reviewer` - user creating the review
- `rating` - rating for the movie
- `title` - title of the movie
- `description` - content of the review

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod anchor_movie_review_program {
    use super::*;

}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct MovieAccountState {
    pub reviewer: Pubkey,    // 32
    pub rating: u8,          // 1
    #[max_len(20)]
    pub title: String,       // 4 + len()
    #[max_len(50)]
    pub description: String, // 4 + len()
}

const DISCRIMINATOR: usize = 8;
```

Using the `#[derive(InitSpace)]` macro on the `AccountStruct` automatically
calculates the `INIT_SPACE` constant which represents the space required for the
account fields, including fixed-size fields and the length-prefixed strings.

In cases of dynamic fields like strings, we can use the `#[max_len]` macro to
specify the maximum length of these fields to determining the space needed for
the account during initialization. Here, we have chosen the `title` string to be
of length 20 (max), and the `description` string to be of length 50 (max).

### Custom error codes

During our implementation, we will be doing some checks and throwing some custom
errors in case those checks are not successful.

For, that let's go ahead and create an enum that will contain the different type
of errors as well as the error messages associated:

```rust
#[error_code]
enum MovieReviewError {
    #[msg("Rating must be between 1 and 5")]
    InvalidRating,
    #[msg("Movie Title too long")]
    TitleTooLong,
    #[msg("Movie Description too long")]
    DescriptionTooLong,
}
```

The `#[error_code]` macro will generate error types to be used as return types
from our instruction handlers.

Don't worry too much about custom errors for now, as they will be covered with
more detail in the next chapter.

### Add Movie Review

Next, let’s implement the `add_movie_review` instruction. The `add_movie_review`
instruction will require a `Context` of type `AddMovieReview` that we’ll
implement shortly.

The instruction will require three additional arguments as instruction data
provided by a reviewer:

- `title` - title of the movie as a `String`
- `description` - details of the review as a `String`
- `rating` - rating for the movie as a `u8`

Within the instruction logic, we’ll populate the data of the new `movie_review`
account with the instruction data. We’ll also set the `reviewer` field as the
`initializer` account from the instruction context.

We will also perform some checks, using the `require!` macro, to make sure that:

- The rating is between 1 and 5
- The title is no longer than 20 characters
- The description is no longer than 50 characters

The `require!` macro will perform a check and throw a custom error in case that
check is not successful.

```rust
const MIN_RATING: u8 = 1;
const MAX_RATING: u8 = 5;
const MAX_TITLE_LENGTH: usize = 20;
const MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH: usize = 50;

#[program]
pub mod anchor_movie_review_program{
    use super::*;

    pub fn add_movie_review(
        ctx: Context<AddMovieReview>,
        title: String,
        description: String,
        rating: u8,
    ) -> Result<()> {
	// We require that the rating is between 1 and 5
        require!(rating >= MIN_RATING && rating <= MAX_RATING, MovieReviewError::InvalidRating);

        // We require that the title is not longer than 20 characters
        require!(title.len() <= MAX_TITLE_LENGTH, MovieReviewError::TitleTooLong);

        // We require that the description is not longer than 50 characters
        require!(description.len() <= MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH, MovieReviewError::DescriptionTooLong);

        msg!("Movie Review Account Created");
        msg!("Title: {}", title);
        msg!("Description: {}", description);
        msg!("Rating: {}", rating);

        let movie_review = &mut ctx.accounts.movie_review;
        movie_review.reviewer = ctx.accounts.initializer.key();
        movie_review.title = title;
        movie_review.rating = rating;
        movie_review.description = description;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Next, let’s create the `AddMovieReview` struct that we used as the generic in
the instruction's context. This struct will list the accounts the
`add_movie_review` instruction requires.

Remember, you'll need the following macros:

- The `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro is used to deserialize and validate the list
  of accounts specified within the struct
- The `#[instruction(...)]` attribute macro is used to access the instruction
  data passed into the instruction
- The `#[account(...)]` attribute macro then specifies additional constraints on
  the accounts

The `movie_review` account is a PDA that needs to be initialized, so we'll add
the `seeds` and `bump` constraints as well as the `init` constraint with its
required `payer` and `space` constraints.

For the PDA seeds, we'll use the movie title and the reviewer's public key. The
payer for the initialization should be the reviewer, and the space allocated on
the account should be enough for the account discriminator, the reviewer's
public key, and the movie review's rating, title, and description.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(title:String, description:String)]
pub struct AddMovieReview<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [title.as_bytes(), initializer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = initializer,
        space = DISCRIMINATOR + MovieAccountState::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub movie_review: Account<'info, MovieAccountState>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub initializer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

### Update Movie Review

Next, let’s implement the `update_movie_review` instruction with a context whose
generic type is `UpdateMovieReview`.

Just as before, the instruction will require three additional arguments as
instruction data provided by a reviewer:

- `title` - title of the movie
- `description` - details of the review
- `rating` - rating for the movie

Within the instruction logic we’ll update the `rating` and `description` stored
on the `movie_review` account.

While the `title` doesn't get used in the instruction function itself, we'll
need it for account validation of `movie_review` in the next step.

```rust
#[program]
pub mod anchor_movie_review_program {
    use super::*;

		...

    pub fn update_movie_review(
        ctx: Context<UpdateMovieReview>,
        title: String,
        description: String,
        rating: u8,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        msg!("Movie review account space reallocated");
        msg!("Title: {}", title);
        msg!("Description: {}", description);
        msg!("Rating: {}", rating);

        let movie_review = &mut ctx.accounts.movie_review;
        movie_review.rating = rating;
        movie_review.description = description;

        Ok(())
    }

}
```

Next, let’s create the `UpdateMovieReview` struct to define the accounts that
the `update_movie_review` instruction needs.

Since the `movie_review` account will have already been initialized by this
point, we no longer need the `init` constraint. However, since the value of
`description` may now be different, we need to use the `realloc` constraint to
reallocate the space on the account. Accompanying this, we need the `mut`,
`realloc::payer`, and `realloc::zero` constraints.

We'll also still need the `seeds` and `bump` constraints as we had them in
`AddMovieReview`.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(title:String, description:String)]
pub struct UpdateMovieReview<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [title.as_bytes(), initializer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        realloc = DISCRIMINATOR + MovieAccountState::INIT_SPACE
        realloc::payer = initializer,
        realloc::zero = true,
    )]
    pub movie_review: Account<'info, MovieAccountState>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub initializer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

Note that the `realloc` constraint is set to the new space required by the
`movie_review` account based on the updated value of `description`.

Additionally, the `realloc::payer` constraint specifies that any additional
lamports required or refunded will come from or be send to the `initializer`
account.

Finally, we set the `realloc::zero` constraint to `true` because the
`movie_review` account may be updated multiple times either shrinking or
expanding the space allocated to the account.

### Delete Movie Review

Lastly, let’s implement the `delete_movie_review` instruction to close an
existing `movie_review` account.

We'll use a context whose generic type is `DeleteMovieReview` and won't include
any additional instruction data. Since we are only closing an account, we
actually don't need any instruction logic inside the body of the function. The
closing itself will be handled by the Anchor constraint in the
`DeleteMovieReview` type.

```rust
#[program]
pub mod anchor_movie_review_program {
    use super::*;

		...

    pub fn delete_movie_review(_ctx: Context<DeleteMovieReview>, title: String) -> Result<()> {
        msg!("Movie review for {} deleted", title);
        Ok(())
    }

}
```

Next, let’s implement the `DeleteMovieReview` struct.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(title: String)]
pub struct DeleteMovieReview<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds=[title.as_bytes(), initializer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        close=initializer
    )]
    pub movie_review: Account<'info, MovieAccountState>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub initializer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>
}
```

Here we use the `close` constraint to specify we are closing the `movie_review`
account and that the rent should be refunded to the `initializer` account. We
also include the `seeds` and `bump` constraints for the `movie_review` account
for validation. Anchor then handles the additional logic required to securely
close the account.

### Testing

The program should be good to go! Now let's test it out. Navigate to
`anchor-movie-review-program.ts` and replace the default test code with the
following.

Here we:

- Create default values for the movie review instruction data
- Derive the movie review account PDA
- Create placeholders for tests

```typescript
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { AnchorMovieReviewProgram } from "../target/types/anchor_movie_review_program";

describe("anchor-movie-review-program", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace
    .AnchorMovieReviewProgram as Program<AnchorMovieReviewProgram>;

  const movie = {
    title: "Just a test movie",
    description: "Wow what a good movie it was real great",
    rating: 5,
  };

  const [moviePda] = anchor.web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [Buffer.from(movie.title), provider.wallet.publicKey.toBuffer()],
    program.programId,
  );

  it("Movie review is added`", async () => {});

  it("Movie review is updated`", async () => {});

  it("Deletes a movie review", async () => {});
});
```

Next, let's create the first test for the `addMovieReview` instruction. Note
that we don't explicitly add `.accounts`. This is because the `Wallet` from
`AnchorProvider` is automatically included as a signer, Anchor can infer certain
accounts like `SystemProgram`, and Anchor can also infer the `movieReview` PDA
from the `title` instruction argument and the signer's public key.

<Callout type="note">Don't forget to turn on seed inference with `seeds = true`
in the `Anchor.toml` file.</Callout>

Once the instruction runs, we then fetch the `movieReview` account and check
that the data stored on the account match the expected values.

```typescript
it("Movie review is added`", async () => {
  // Add your test here.
  const tx = await program.methods
    .addMovieReview(movie.title, movie.description, movie.rating)
    .rpc();

  const account = await program.account.movieAccountState.fetch(moviePda);
  expect(movie.title === account.title);
  expect(movie.rating === account.rating);
  expect(movie.description === account.description);
  expect(account.reviewer === provider.wallet.publicKey);
});
```

Next, let's create the test for the `updateMovieReview` instruction following
the same process as before.

```typescript
it("Movie review is updated`", async () => {
  const newDescription = "Wow this is new";
  const newRating = 4;

  const tx = await program.methods
    .updateMovieReview(movie.title, newDescription, newRating)
    .rpc();

  const account = await program.account.movieAccountState.fetch(moviePda);
  expect(movie.title === account.title);
  expect(newRating === account.rating);
  expect(newDescription === account.description);
  expect(account.reviewer === provider.wallet.publicKey);
});
```

Next, create the test for the `deleteMovieReview` instruction

```typescript
it("Deletes a movie review", async () => {
  const tx = await program.methods.deleteMovieReview(movie.title).rpc();
});
```

Lastly, run `anchor test` and you should see the following output in the
console.

```bash
  anchor-movie-review-program
    ✔ Movie review is added` (139ms)
    ✔ Movie review is updated` (404ms)
    ✔ Deletes a movie review (403ms)


  3 passing (950ms)
```

## Challenge

Now it’s your turn to build something independently. Equipped with the concepts
introduced in this lesson, try to recreate the Student Intro program that we've
used before using the Anchor framework.

The Student Intro program is a Solana Program that lets students introduce
themselves. The program takes a user's name and a short message as the
instruction data and creates an account to store the data onchain.

Using what you've learned in this lesson, build out this program. The program
should include instructions to:

1. Initialize a PDA account for each student that stores the student's name and
   their short message
2. Update the message on an existing account
3. Close an existing account

Try to do this independently if you can! But if you get stuck, feel free to
reference
the [solution code](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/anchor-student-intro-program).
