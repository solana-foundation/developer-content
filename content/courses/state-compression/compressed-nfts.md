## Summary

- **Compressed NFTs (cNFTs)** use **State Compression** to hash NFT data and
  store the hash onchain in an account using a **concurrent Merkle tree**
  structure.
- The cNFT data hash can’t be used to infer the cNFT data, but it can be used to
  **verify** if the cNFT data you’re seeing is correct.
- Supporting RPC providers **index** cNFT data offchain when the cNFT is minted
  so that you can use the **Read API** to access the data
- The **Metaplex Bubblegum program** is an abstraction on top of the **State
  Compression** program that enables you to more simply create, mint, and manage
  cNFT collections.

## Lesson

Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) are exactly what their name suggests: NFTs whose
structure takes up less account storage than traditional NFTs. Compressed NFTs
leverage a concept called **State Compression** to store data in a way that
drastically reduces costs.

Solana’s transaction costs are so cheap that most users never think about how
expensive minting NFTs can be at scale. The cost to set up and mint 1 million
traditional NFTs using the Token Metadata Program is approximately 24,000 SOL.
By comparison, cNFTs can be structured to where the same setup and mint costs 10
SOL or less. That means anyone using NFTs at scale could cut costs by more than
1000x by using cNFTs over traditional NFTs.

However, cNFTs can be tricky to work with. Eventually, the tooling required to
work with them will be sufficiently abstracted from the underlying technology
that the developer experience between traditional NFTs and cNFTs will be
negligible. But for now, you’ll still need to understand the low level puzzle
pieces, so let’s dig in!

### A theoretical overview of cNFTs

Most of the costs associated with traditional NFTs come down to account storage
space. Compressed NFTs use a concept called State Compression to store data in
the blockchain’s **ledger state**, only using the account state to store a
“fingerprint”, or **hash**, of the data. This hash allows you to
cryptographically verify that data has not been tampered with.

To both store hashes and enable verification, we use a special binary tree
structure known as a **concurrent Merkle tree**. This tree structure lets us
hash data together in a deterministic way to compute a single, final hash that
gets stored onchain. This final hash is significantly smaller than all the
original data combined, hence the “compression.” The steps to this process are:

1. Take any piece of data
2. Create a hash of this data
3. Store this hash as a “leaf” at the bottom of the tree
4. Each leaf pair is then hashed together, creating a “branch”
5. Each branch is then hashed together
6. Continually climb the tree and hash adjacent branches together
7. Once at the top of the tree, a final ”root hash” is produced
8. Store the root hash onchain as a verifiable proof of the data within each
   leaf
9. Anyone wanting to verify that the data they have matches the “source of
   truth” can go through the same process and compare the final hash without
   having to store all the data onchain

One problem not addressed in the above is how to make data available if it can’t
be fetched from an account. Since this hashing process occurs onchain, all the
data exists in the ledger state and could theoretically be retrieved from the
original transaction by replaying the entire chain state from origin. However,
it’s much more straightforward (though still complicated) to have an **indexer**
track and index this data as the transactions occur. This ensures there is an
offchain “cache” of the data that anyone can access and subsequently verify
against the onchain root hash.

This process is _very complex_. We’ll cover some key concepts below but don’t
worry if you don’t understand it right away. We’ll talk more theory in the state
compression lesson and focus primarily on application to NFTs in this lesson.
You’ll be able to work with cNFTs by the end of this lesson even if you don’t
fully understand every piece of the state compression puzzle.

#### Concurrent Merkle trees

A **Merkle tree** is a binary tree structure represented by a single hash. Every
leaf node in the structure is a hash of its inner data while every branch is a
hash of its child leaf hashes. In turn, branches are also hashed together until
eventually one final root hash remains.

Any modification to leaf data changes the root hash. This causes an issue when
multiple transactions in the same slot are attempting to modify leaf data. Since
these transactions must execute in series, all but the first will fail since the
root hash and proof passed in will have been invalidated by the first
transaction to be executed.

A **concurrent Merkle tree** is a Merkle tree that stores a secure changelog of
the most recent changes along with their root hash and the proof to derive it.
When multiple transactions in the same slot try to modify leaf data, the
changelog can be used as a source of truth to allow for concurrent changes to be
made to the tree.

When working with a concurrent Merkle tree, there are three variables that
determine the size of the tree, the cost to create the tree, and the number of
concurrent changes that can be made to the tree:

1. Max depth
2. Max buffer size
3. Canopy depth

The **max depth** is the maximum number of hops to get from any leaf to the root
of the tree. Since Merkle trees are binary trees, every leaf is connected only
to one other leaf. Max depth can then logically be used to calculate the number
of nodes for the tree with `2 ^ maxDepth`.

The **max buffer size** is effectively the maximum number of concurrent changes
that you can make to a tree within a single slot with the root hash still being
valid.

The **canopy depth** is the number of proof nodes that are stored onchain for
any given proof path. Verifying any leaf requires the complete proof path for
the tree. The complete proof path is made up of one proof node for every “layer”
of the tree, i.e. a max depth of 14 means there are 14 proof nodes. Every proof
node adds 32 bytes to a transaction, so large trees would quickly exceed the
maximum transaction size limit without caching proof nodes onchain.

Each of these three values, max depth, max buffer size, and canopy depth, comes
with a tradeoff. Increasing any of these values increases the size of the
account used to store the tree, thus increasing the cost to create the tree.

Choosing the max depth is fairly straightforward as it directly relates to the
number of leafs and therefore the amount of data you can store. If you need
1million cNFTs on a single tree, find the max depth that makes the following
expression true: `2^maxDepth > 1million`. The answer is 20.

Choosing a max buffer size is effectively a question of throughput: how many
concurrent writes do you need.

#### SPL State Compression and Noop Programs

The SPL State Compression Program exists to make the above process repeatable
and composable throughout the Solana ecosystem. It provides instructions for
initializing Merkle trees, managing tree leafs (i.e. add, update, remove data),
and verifying leaf data.

The State Compression Program also leverages a separate “no op” program whose
primary purpose is to make leaf data easier to index by logging it to the ledger
state.

#### Use the Ledger State for storage

The Solana ledger is a list of entries containing signed transactions. In
theory, this can be traced back to the genesis block. This effectively means any
data that has ever been put into a transaction exists in the ledger.

When you want to store compressed data, you pass it to the State Compression
program where it gets hashed and emitted as an “event” to the Noop program. The
hash is then stored in the corresponding concurrent Merkle tree. Since the data
passed through a transaction and even exists on the Noop program logs, it will
forever exist on the ledger state.

#### Index data for easy lookup

Under normal conditions, you would typically access onchain data by fetching the
appropriate account. When using state compression, however, it’s not so
straightforward.

As mentioned above, the data now exists in the ledger state rather than in an
account. The easiest place to find the full data is in the logs of the Noop
instruction, but while this data will in a sense exist in the ledger state
forever, it will likely be inaccessible through validators after a certain
period of time.

To save space and be more performant, validators don’t retain every transaction
back to the genesis block. The specific amount of time you’ll be able to access
the Noop instruction logs related to your data will vary based on the validator,
but eventually you’ll lose access to it if you’re relying directly on
instruction logs.

Technically, you _can_ replay transaction state back to the genesis block, but
the average team isn’t going to do that, and it certainly won’t be performant.
Instead, you should use an indexer that will observe the events sent to the Noop
program and store the relevant data off chain. That way you don’t need to worry
about old data becoming inaccessible.

### Create a cNFT Collection

With the theoretical background out of the way, let’s turn our attention to the
main point of this lesson: how to create a cNFT collection.

Fortunately, you can use tools created by Solana Foundation, the Solana
developer community, and Metaplex to simplify the process. Specifically, we’ll
be using the `@solana/spl-account-compression` SDK, the Metaplex Bubblegum
program `@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bugglegum` through the Umi library from
Metaplex.

#### Prepare metadata

Prior to starting, you’ll prepare your NFT metadata similarly to how you would
if you were using a Candy Machine. At its core, an NFT is simply a token with
metadata that follows the NFT standard. In other words, it should be shaped
something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "My Collection",
  "symbol": "MC",
  "description": "My Collection description",
  "image": "https://lvvg33dqzykc2mbfa4ifua75t73tchjnfjbcspp3n3baabugh6qq.arweave.net/XWpt7HDOFC0wJQcQWgP9n_cxHS0qQik9-27CAAaGP6E",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Background",
      "value": "transparent"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Shape",
      "value": "sphere"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Resolution",
      "value": "1920x1920"
    }
  ]
}
```

Depending on your use case, you may be able to generate this dynamically, or you
might want to have a JSON file prepared for each cNFT beforehand. You’ll also
need any other assets referenced by the JSON, such as the `image` URL shown in
the example above.

#### Create Collection NFT

If you want your cNFTs to be part of a collection, you’ll need to create a
Collection NFT **before** you start minting cNFTs. This is a traditional NFT
that acts as the reference binding your cNFTs together into a single collection.
This will be a Token Metadata program NFT with the fields `isCollection` set to
`true` created using the `@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata` library. You
can check out more on this in the
[NFTs with Metaplex lesson](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/blob/main/content/courses/tokens-and-nfts/nfts-with-metaplex.md)

<!-- todo! update above link once lesson goes live -->

```typescript
const collectionMint = generateSigner(umi);

await createNft(umi, {
  mint: collectionMint,
  name: `My Collection`,
  uri,
  sellerFeeBasisPoints: percentAmount(0),
  isCollection: true, // mint as collection NFT
}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

#### Create Merkle tree Account

Now we start to deviate from the process you would use when creating traditional
NFTs. The onchain storage mechanism you use for state compression is an account
representing a concurrent Merkle tree. This Merkle tree account belongs to the
SPL State Compression program. Before you can do anything related to cNFTs, you
need to create an empty Merkle tree account with the appropriate size.

The variables impacting the size of the account are:

1. Max depth
2. Max buffer size
3. Canopy depth

The first two variables must be chosen from an existing set of valid pairs. The
table below shows the valid pairs along with the number of cNFTs that can be
created with those values.

| Max Depth | Max Buffer Size | Max Number of cNFTs |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 3         | 8               | 8                   |
| 5         | 8               | 32                  |
| 14        | 64              | 16,384              |
| 14        | 256             | 16,384              |
| 14        | 1,024           | 16,384              |
| 14        | 2,048           | 16,384              |
| 15        | 64              | 32,768              |
| 16        | 64              | 65,536              |
| 17        | 64              | 131,072             |
| 18        | 64              | 262,144             |
| 19        | 64              | 524,288             |
| 20        | 64              | 1,048,576           |
| 20        | 256             | 1,048,576           |
| 20        | 1,024           | 1,048,576           |
| 20        | 2,048           | 1,048,576           |
| 24        | 64              | 16,777,216          |
| 24        | 256             | 16,777,216          |
| 24        | 512             | 16,777,216          |
| 24        | 1,024           | 16,777,216          |
| 24        | 2,048           | 16,777,216          |
| 26        | 512             | 67,108,864          |
| 26        | 1,024           | 67,108,864          |
| 26        | 2,048           | 67,108,864          |
| 30        | 512             | 1,073,741,824       |
| 30        | 1,024           | 1,073,741,824       |
| 30        | 2,048           | 1,073,741,824       |

Note that the number of cNFTs that can be stored on the tree depends entirely on
the max depth, while the buffer size will determine the number of concurrent
changes (mints, transfers, etc.) within the same slot that can occur to the
tree. In other words, choose the max depth that corresponds to the number of
NFTs you need the tree to hold, then choose one of the options for max buffer
size based on the traffic you expect you’ll need to support.

Next, choose the canopy depth. Increasing the canopy depth increases the
composability of your cNFTs. Any time your or another developer’s code attempts
to verify a cNFT down the road, the code will have to pass in as many proof
nodes as there are “layers” in your tree. So for a max depth of 20, you’ll need
to pass in 20 proof nodes. Not only is this tedious, but since each proof node
is 32 bytes it’s possible to max out transaction sizes very quickly.

For example, if your tree has a very low canopy depth, an NFT marketplace may
only be able to support simple NFTs transfers rather than support an onchain
bidding system for your cNFTs. The canopy effectively caches proof nodes
onchain, so you don’t have to pass all of them into the transaction, allowing
for more complex transactions.

Increasing any of these three values increases the size of the account, thereby
increasing the cost associated with creating it. Weigh the benefits accordingly
when choosing the values.

Once you know these values, you can use the `createTree` method from the
`@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum` package to create your tree. This
instruction creates and initializes two accounts

1. `Merkle Tree` account that holds the merkle hash and used to verify the
   authenticity of data stored.
2. `Tree Config` account that holds additional data specific to compressed NFTs
   such as the tree creator, whether the tree is public. Find mnore fileds about
   the fields the account stores on the
   [program source code.](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum/blob/42ffed35da6b2a673efacd63030a360eac3ae64e/programs/bubblegum/program/src/state/mod.rs#L17)

#### Setting up Umi

The `mpl-bubblegum` package is a plugin and cannot be used without the Umi
library from Metaplex. Umi is a framework for making JS/TS clients for onchain
programs, that was created by Metaplex.

Note that Umi has different implementations for many concepts than web3.js,
including Keypairs, PublicKeys, and Connections. However, it is easy to convert
from web3.js versions of these items to the Umi equivalents.

To get started, we need to create an Umi instance

```typescript
import { createUmi } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

const umi = createUmi(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));
```

The above code initializes an empty Umi instance without any signer or plugin
attached to it. You can find the exhaustive list of the plugins available
[on this Metaplex docs page](https://developers.metaplex.com/umi/metaplex-umi-plugins)

The nxt part is to add in our imports and attach a signer to our Umi instance.

```typescript
import { dasApi } from "@metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api";
import { createTree, mplBubblegum } from "@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum";
import { keypairIdentity } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi";
import { createUmi } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults";
import { getKeypairFromFile } from "@solana-developers/helpers";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

const umi = createUmi(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));

// load keypair from local file system
// See https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#get-a-keypair-from-a-keypair-file
const localKeypair = await getKeypairFromFile();

// convert to Umi compatible keypair
const umiKeypair = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(localKeypair.secretKey);

// load the MPL Bubblegum program, dasApi plugin and assign a signer to our umi instance
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiKeypair)).use(mplBubblegum()).use(dasApi());

console.log("everythying is fine");
```

#### Use Bubblegum to Initialize Your Tree

With Umi instantiated, we are ready to call the `createTree` method to
instantiate the Merkle tree and tree config accounts.

```typescript
const merkleTree = generateSigner(umi);
const builder = await createTree(umi, {
  merkleTree,
  maxDepth: 14,
  maxBufferSize: 64,
});
await builder.sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

The three values supplied i.e the `merkleTree`, `maxDepth` and `maxBufferSize`
are required in order to create the tree while the rest are optional. For
example, the`tree creator` defaults to the Umi instance identity, while the
`public field to false.

When set to true, `public` allows anyone to mint from the initialized tree and
if false, only the tree creator will be able to mint from the tree.

Feel free to take a look at the program code for the
[accounts](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum/blob/42ffed35da6b2a673efacd63030a360eac3ae64e/programs/bubblegum/program/src/processor/create_tree.rs#L20)
and the
[arguments](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum/blob/42ffed35da6b2a673efacd63030a360eac3ae64e/programs/bubblegum/program/src/processor/create_tree.rs#L40)
the instruction takes.

#### Mint cNFTs

With the Merkle tree account and its corresponding Bubblegum tree config account
initialized, it’s possible to mint cNFTs to the tree. The Bubblegum library,
provides two instruction we can make use of depending on whether the minted
asset will belong to a collection.

The two instructions are

1. **MintV1**

```typescript
await mintV1(umi, {
  leafOwner,
  merkleTree,
  metadata: {
    name: "My Compressed NFT",
    uri: "https://example.com/my-cnft.json",
    sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0, // 0%
    collection: none(),
    creators: [
      { address: umi.identity.publicKey, verified: false, share: 100 },
    ],
  },
}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

2. **mintToCollectionV1**

```typescript
await mintToCollectionV1(umi, {
  leafOwner,
  merkleTree,
  collectionMint,
  metadata: {
    name: "My Compressed NFT",
    uri: "https://example.com/my-cnft.json",
    sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0, // 0%
    collection: { key: collectionMint, verified: false },
    creators: [
      { address: umi.identity.publicKey, verified: false, share: 100 },
    ],
  },
}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

Both functions will require you to pass in the NFT metadata and a list of
accounts required to mint the cNFT such as the `leafOwner`, `merkleTree` account
e.t.c

### Interact with cNFTs

It’s important to note that cNFTs _are not_ SPL tokens. That means your code
needs to follow different conventions to handle cNFT functionality like
fetching, querying, transferring, etc.

#### Fetch cNFT data

The simplest way to fetch data from an existing cNFT is to use the
[Digital Asset Standard Read API](https://developers.metaplex.com/das-api) (Read
API). Note that this is separate from the standard JSON RPC. To use the Read
API, you’ll need to use a supporting RPC Provider. Metaplex maintains a (likely
non-exhaustive)
[list of RPC providers](https://developers.metaplex.com/rpc-providers#rpcs-with-das-support)
that support the Read API.

In this lesson we’ll be using
[Helius](https://docs.helius.dev/compression-and-das-api/digital-asset-standard-das-api)
as they have free support for Devnet.

You might need to update your RPC connection endpoint in the Umi instantiation

```typescript
const umi = createUmi(
  "https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR-HELIUS-API-KEY",
);
```

To use the Read API to fetch a specific cNFT, you need to have the cNFT’s asset
ID. However, after minting cNFTs, you’ll have at most two pieces of information:

1. The transaction signature
2. The leaf index (possibly)

The only real guarantee is that you’ll have the transaction signature. It is
**possible** to locate the leaf index from there, but it involves some fairly
complex parsing. The short story is you must retrieve the relevant instruction
logs from the Noop program and parse them to find the leaf index. We’ll cover
this more in depth in a future lesson. For now, we’ll assume you know the leaf
index.

This is a reasonable assumption for most mints given that the minting will be
controlled by your code and can be set up sequentially so that your code can
track which index is going to be used for each mint. I.e. the first mint will
use index 0, the second index 1, etc.

Once you have the leaf index, you can derive the cNFT’s corresponding asset ID.
When using Bubblegum, the asset ID is a PDA derived using the Bubblegum program
ID and the following seeds:

1. The static string `asset` represented in utf8 encoding
2. The Merkle tree address
3. The leaf index

The indexer essentially observes transaction logs from the Noop program as they
happen and stores the cNFT metadata that was hashed and stored in the Merkle
tree. This enables them to surface that data when requested. This asset id is
what the indexer uses to identify the particular asset.

For simplicity, you can just use the `findLeafAssetIdPda` helper function from
the bubblegum library.

```typescript
const [assetId, bump] = await findLeafAssetIdPda(umi, {
  merkleTree,
  leafIndex,
});
```

With the asset ID, fetching the cNFT is fairly straightforward. Simply use the
`getAsset` method provided by the supporting RPC provider and the `dasApi`
library:

```typescript
const [assetId, bump] = await findLeafAssetIdPda(umi, {
  merkleTree,
  leafIndex,
});

const rpcAsset = await umi.rpc.getAsset(assetId);
```

This will return a JSON object that is comprehensive of what a traditional NFT’s
on- and offchain metadata would look like combined. For example, you can find
the cNFT attributes at `content.metadata.attributes` or the image at
`content.files.uri`.

#### Query cNFTs

The Read API also includes ways to get multiple assets, query by owner, creator,
and more. For example, Helius supports the following methods:

- `getAsset`
- `getSignaturesForAsset`
- `searchAssets`
- `getAssetProof`
- `getAssetsByOwner`
- `getAssetsByAuthority`
- `getAssetsByCreator`
- `getAssetsByGroup`

We won’t go over most of these directly, but be sure to look through the
[Helius docs](https://docs.helius.dev/compression-and-das-api/digital-asset-standard-das-api)
to learn how to use them correctly.

#### Transfer cNFTs

Just as with a standard SPL token transfer, security is paramount. An SPL token
transfer, however, makes verifying transfer authority very easy. It’s built into
the SPL Token program and standard signing. A compressed token’s ownership is
more difficult to verify. The actual verification will happen program-side, but
your client-side code needs to provide additional information to make it
possible.

While there is a Bubblegum `createTransferInstruction` helper function, there is
more assembly required than usual. Specifically, the Bubblegum program needs to
verify that the entirety of the cNFT’s data is what the client asserts before a
transfer can occur. The entirety of the cNFT data has been hashed and stored as
a single leaf on the Merkle tree, and the Merkle tree is simply a hash of all
the tree’s leafs and branches. Because of this, you can’t simply tell the
program what account to look at and have it compare that account’s `authority`
or `owner` field to the transaction signer.

Instead, you need to provide the entirety of the cNFT data and any of the Merkle
tree’s proof information that isn’t stored in the canopy. That way, the program
can independently prove that the provided cNFT data, and therefore the cNFT
owner, is accurate. Only then can the program safely determine if the
transaction signer should, in fact, be allowed to transfer the cNFT.

In broad terms, this involves a five step process:

1. Fetch the cNFT's asset data from the indexer
2. Fetch the cNFT's proof from the indexer
3. Fetch the Merkle tree account from the Solana blockchain
4. Prepare the asset proof as a list of `AccountMeta` objects
5. Build and send the Bubblegum transfer instruction

Fortunately, we can make use of the `transfer` method which takes care of all
these steps.

```typescript
const assetWithProof = await getAssetWithProof(umi, assetId);

await transfer(umi, {
  ...assetWithProof,
  leafOwner: currentLeafOwner,
  newLeafOwner: newLeafOwner.publicKey,
}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

### Conclusion

We’ve covered the primary skills needed to interact with cNFTs, but haven’t been
fully comprehensive. You can also use Bubblegum to do things like burn, verify,
delegate, and more. We won’t go through these, but these instructions are
similar to the mint and transfer process. If you need this additional
functionality, take a look at the
[Bubblegum docs](https://developers.metaplex.com/bubblegum) on how to leverage
the helper functions it provides.

## Lab

Let’s jump in and practice creating and working with cNFTs. Together, we’ll
build as simple a script as possible that will let us mint a cNFT collection
from a Merkle tree.

#### 1. Get the starter code

To begin create and initialize an empty NPM project.

```bash
mkdir cnft-demo && npm init -y
```

Install all the required dependencies

```bash
npm i @solana/web3.js npm i @solana-developers/helpers@2.5.2 npm i @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata npm i @metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum @metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api npm i @metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults  && npm i --save-dev esrun
```

In this first script, we will learn about creating a tree, hence let's create
the file `create-tree.ts`

```bash
mkdir src && touch src/create-tree.ts
```

This Umi instantiation code will be repated in a lot of files, so feel free to
create a wrapper file to instantiate if,

```typescript
import { dasApi } from "@metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api";
import { createTree, mplBubblegum } from "@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum";
import { generateSigner, keypairIdentity } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi";
import { createUmi } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults";
import {
  getExplorerLink,
  getKeypairFromFile,
} from "@solana-developers/helpers";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

const umi = createUmi(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));

// load keypair from local file system
// See https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#get-a-keypair-from-a-keypair-file
const localKeypair = await getKeypairFromFile();

// convert to Umi compatible keypair
const umiKeypair = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(localKeypair.secretKey);

// load the MPL Bubblegum program, dasApi plugin and assign a signer to our umi instance
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiKeypair)).use(mplBubblegum()).use(dasApi());
```

In the code above, we load the user's keypair wallet from the system wallet
located at `.config/solana/id.json`, instantiate a new Umi instance and assign
the keypair to it. We also assign the Bubblegum and dasApi plugins to it as
well.

#### 2. Create the Merkle tree account

We’ll start by creating the Merkle tree account. To do this we will use the
`createTree` method from Metaplex Bubblegum program.

This function takes in three default values

- `merkleTree` - The Merkle tree account address
- `maxDepth` - Determines the max number of leaves the tree will hold and
  therefore the max no. of cNFTs that the tree can contain.
- `maxBufferSize` - Determines how many concurrent changes can occur in the tree
  in parallel.

You can also supply in optional fields such as

- `treeCreator` - The address of the tree authority, defaults to current
  `umi.identity` instance.
- `public` - Determines whether anyone else apart from the tree creator will be
  able to mint cNFTs from the tree.

```typescript
const merkleTree = generateSigner(umi);
const builder = await createTree(umi, {
  merkleTree,
  maxDepth: 14,
  maxBufferSize: 64,
});
await builder.sendAndConfirm(umi);

let explorerLink = getExplorerLink("address", merkleTree.publicKey, "devnet");
console.log(`explorer link: ${explorerLink}`);
console.log("Merkle tree address is :", merkleTree.publicKey);
console.log("✅ Finished successfully!");
```

Run the `create-tree.ts` script using esrun

```bash
npx esrun create-tree.ts
```

Make sure to remember the Merkle tree address as we will be using it in the next
step when minting compressed NFTs.

Your output will be similar to this

```bash
explorer link: https://explorer.solana.com/address/ZwzNxXw83PUmWSypXmqRH669gD3hF9rEjHWPpVghr5h?cluster=devnet
Merkle tree address is : ZwzNxXw83PUmWSypXmqRH669gD3hF9rEjHWPpVghr5h
✅ Finished successfully!
```

Congratulations! You've created a Bubblegum tree. Follow the explorer link to
make sure that the process finished successfully,

![Solana Explorer with details about created Merkle tree](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/solana-explorer-cretae-tree.png)

#### 3. Mint cNFTs to your tree

Believe it or not, that’s all you needed to do to set up your tree to compressed
NFTs! Now let’s turn our attention to minting.

First, let's create a new file called `mint-compressed-nft-to-collection.ts`,
add our imports and instantiate Umi

```typescript
import { dasApi } from "@metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api";
import {
  findLeafAssetIdPda,
  LeafSchema,
  mintToCollectionV1,
  mplBubblegum,
  parseLeafFromMintToCollectionV1Transaction,
} from "@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum";
import {
  keypairIdentity,
  publicKey as UMIPublicKey,
} from "@metaplex-foundation/umi";
import { createUmi } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults";
import { getKeypairFromFile } from "@solana-developers/helpers";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

const umi = createUmi(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));

// load keypair from local file system
// See https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#get-a-keypair-from-a-keypair-file
const localKeypair = await getKeypairFromFile();

// convert to Umi compatible keypair
const umiKeypair = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(localKeypair.secretKey);

// load the MPL Bubblegum program, dasApi plugin and assign a signer to our umi instance
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiKeypair)).use(mplBubblegum()).use(dasApi());
```

I am going to be
[recycling a Collection NFT](https://explorer.solana.com/address/D2zi1QQmtZR5fk7wpA1Fmf6hTY2xy8xVMyNgfq6LsKy1?cluster=devnet)
I already created in the NFTs with Metaplex lesson, but if you'd like to create
a new collection for this lesson, check out the code
[on this repo](https://github.com/solana-developers/professional-education/blob/main/labs/metaplex-umi/create-collection.ts)

<!-- todo(should there be a section for creating a collection with MPL metadata) -->

To mint a compressed NFT to a collection we will need

- `leafOwner` - The recipient of the compressed NFT

- `merkleTree` - The Merkle tree address we created in the previous step

- `collection` - The collection our cNFT will belong to. This is not required
  and you can leave it out if your cNFT doesn't belong to a collection.

- `metadata` - Your off-chain metadata. This lesson won't focus onto how to
  prepare your metadata but you can check out the
  [recommended structure from Metaplex](https://developers.metaplex.com/token-metadata/token-standard#the-non-fungible-standard).

Our cNFT will use this structure we already prepared earlier.

```json
{
  "name": "My NFT",
  "symbol": "MN",
  "description": "My NFT Description",
  "image": "https://lycozm33rkk5ozjqldiuzc6drazmdp5d5g3g7foh3gz6rz5zp7va.arweave.net/XgTss3uKlddlMFjRTIvDiDLBv6Pptm-Vx9mz6Oe5f-o",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Background",
      "value": "transparent"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Shape",
      "value": "sphere"
    }
  ]
}
```

Putting it all into code, we will have

```typescript
const merkleTree = UMIPublicKey("ZwzNxXw83PUmWSypXmqRH669gD3hF9rEjHWPpVghr5h");

const collectionMint = UMIPublicKey(
  "D2zi1QQmtZR5fk7wpA1Fmf6hTY2xy8xVMyNgfq6LsKy1",
);

const uintSig = await(
  await mintToCollectionV1(umi, {
    leafOwner: umi.identity.publicKey,
    merkleTree,
    collectionMint,
    metadata: {
      name: "My NFT",
      uri: "https://chocolate-wet-narwhal-846.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeBRVEmASS3pyK9YZDkRUtAham74JBUZQE3WD4u4Hibv9",
      sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0, // 0%
      collection: { key: collectionMint, verified: false },
      creators: [
        {
          address: umi.identity.publicKey,
          verified: false,
          share: 100,
        },
      ],
    },
  }).sendAndConfirm(umi),
).signature;

const b64Sig = base58.deserialize(uintSig);
console.log(b64Sig);
```

The difference between the first statement is that we are returning the byte
array representing the transaction signature.

We need this has in order to be able to get the leaf schema and with this schema
derive the asset ID.

```typescript
const leaf: LeafSchema = await parseLeafFromMintToCollectionV1Transaction(
  umi,
  uintSig,
);
const assetId = findLeafAssetIdPda(umi, {
  merkleTree,
  leafIndex: leaf.nonce,
})[0];
```

With everything in place, we can now run our script
`mint-compressed-nft-to-collection.ts`

```bash
npx esrun mint-compressed-nft-to-collection.ts
```

Your output should resemble

```bash
asset id: D4A8TYkKE5NzkqBQ4mPybgFbAUDN53fwJ64b8HwEEuUS
✅ Finished successfully!
```

We aren't returning the explorer link because this address won't exists on the
Solana state but is indexed by RPCs that support the DAS API.

In the next step we will query this address to fetch out cNFT details.

#### 4. Read existing cNFT data

Now that we’ve written code to mint cNFTs, let’s see if we can actually fetch
their data.

Create a new file `fetch-cnft-details.ts`

```bash
fetch-cnft-details.ts
```

Import our packages and instantiate Umi. Here we will finally make use of the
`umi.use(dasApi())` we've been importing.

In the instantiation of Umi, we are going to make a change to our connection
endpoint and use an RPC that supports the DAS API.

Be sure to update this with your Helius API keys which you can get from the
[developer dashboard page](https://dashboard.helius.dev/signup?redirectTo=onboarding)

```typescript
import { dasApi } from "@metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api";
import { mplBubblegum } from "@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum";
import {
  keypairIdentity,
  publicKey as UMIPublicKey,
} from "@metaplex-foundation/umi";
import { createUmi } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults";
import { getKeypairFromFile } from "@solana-developers/helpers";

const umi = createUmi(
  "https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR-HELIUS-API-KEY",
);

// load keypair from local file system
// See https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#get-a-keypair-from-a-keypair-file
const localKeypair = await getKeypairFromFile();

// convert to Umi compatible keypair
const umiKeypair = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(localKeypair.secretKey);

// load the MPL Bubblegum program, dasApi plugin and assign a signer to our umi instance
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiKeypair)).use(mplBubblegum()).use(dasApi());
```

Fetching a compressed NFT details is as simple as calling the `getAsset` method
with the `assetId` from the previous step.

```typescript
const assetId = UMIPublicKey("D4A8TYkKE5NzkqBQ4mPybgFbAUDN53fwJ64b8HwEEuUS");

// @ts-ignore
const rpcAsset = await umi.rpc.getAsset(assetId);
console.log(rpcAsset);
```

Let’s start by declaring a function `logNftDetails` that takes as parameters
`treeAddress` and `nftsMinted`.

The output of our console.log would output

```json
{
  interface: 'V1_NFT',
  id: 'D4A8TYkKE5NzkqBQ4mPybgFbAUDN53fwJ64b8HwEEuUS',

  },
  supply: { print_max_supply: 0, print_current_supply: 0, edition_nonce: null },
  mutable: true,

}
```

Remember, the Read API also includes ways to get multiple assets, query by
owner, creator, etc., and more. Be sure to look through the
[Helius docs](https://docs.helius.dev/compression-and-das-api/digital-asset-standard-das-api)
to see what’s available.

#### 5. Transfer a cNFT

The last thing we’re going to add to our script is a cNFT transfer. Just as with
a standard SPL token transfer, security is paramount. Unlike with a standard SPL
token transfer, however, to build a secure transfer with state compression of
any kind, the program performing the transfer needs the entire asset data.

Fortunately for us can get the asset data with the `getAssetWithProof` method.

Le't first create a new file `transfer-asset.ts`, and populate it with the code
for instantiating a new Umi client.

```bash
touch transfer-asset.ts
```

```typescript
import { dasApi } from "@metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api";
import {
  getAssetWithProof,
  mplBubblegum,
  transfer,
} from "@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum";
import {
  keypairIdentity,
  publicKey as UMIPublicKey,
} from "@metaplex-foundation/umi";
import { createUmi } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults";
import { base58 } from "@metaplex-foundation/umi/serializers";
import {
  getExplorerLink,
  getKeypairFromFile,
} from "@solana-developers/helpers";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

const umi = createUmi(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));

// load keypair from local file system
// See https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#get-a-keypair-from-a-keypair-file
const localKeypair = await getKeypairFromFile();

// convert to Umi compatible keypair
const umiKeypair = umi.eddsa.createKeypairFromSecretKey(localKeypair.secretKey);

// load the MPL Bubblegum program, dasApi plugin and assign a signer to our umi instance
umi.use(keypairIdentity(umiKeypair)).use(mplBubblegum()).use(dasApi());
```

We are not ready to transfer our asset. Using the `assetId` for our cNFT, we can
call the `transfer` method from the Bubblegum library

```typescript
const assetId = UMIPublicKey("D4A8TYkKE5NzkqBQ4mPybgFbAUDN53fwJ64b8HwEEuUS");

//@ts-ignore
const assetWithProof = await getAssetWithProof(umi, assetId);

let uintSig = await(
  await transfer(umi, {
    ...assetWithProof,
    leafOwner: umi.identity.publicKey,
    newLeafOwner: UMIPublicKey("J63YroB8AwjDVjKuxjcYFKypVM3aBeQrfrVmNBxfmThB"),
  }).sendAndConfirm(umi),
).signature;

const b64sig = base58.deserialize(uintSig);

let explorerLink = getExplorerLink("transaction", b64sig, "devnet");
console.log(`explorer link: ${explorerLink}`);
console.log("✅ Finished successfully!");
```

Running our script with `npx esrun transfer-asset.ts`, should output something
similar to this if successful:

```bash
explorer link: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3sNgN7Gnh5FqcJ7ZuUEXFDw5WeojpwkDjdfvTNWy68YCEJUF8frpnUJdHhHFXAtoopsytzkKewh39Rf7phFQ2hCF?cluster=devnet
✅ Finished successfully!
```

Open the explorer link, and scroll to the bottom to observer your tx logs,

![Solana Explorer showing logs of the transfer cnft instruction](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/solana-explorer-showing-cnft-transfer-logs.png)

Congratulations! Now you know how to mint, read, and transfer cNFTs. If you
wanted, you could update the max depth, max buffer size, and canopy depth to
larger values and as long as you have enough Devnet SOL, this script will let
you mint up to 10k cNFTs for a small fraction of what it would cost to mint 10k
traditional NFTs.

Inspect the updated NFT on Solana Explorer! Just like previously, if you have
any issues, you should fix them yourself, but if needed the
[solution code](<!-- todo(Jimii) -->) is available.

### Challenge

It’s your turn to take these concepts for a spin on your own! We’re not going to
be overly prescriptive at this point, but here are some ideas:

1. Create your own production cNFT collection
2. Build a UI for this lesson’s lab that will let you mint a cNFT and display it
3. See if you can replicate some of the lab script’s functionality in an onchain
   program, i.e. write a program that can mint cNFTs
