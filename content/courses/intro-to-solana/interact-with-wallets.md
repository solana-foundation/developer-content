## Summary

- **Wallets** store your secret key and allow users to sign transactions
- **Hardware wallets** store your secret key on a separate device
- **Software wallets** use your computer for secure storage. On desktops,
  software wallets are often **browser extensions** that add the ability to
  connect to a wallet from a website. On mobile, wallet apps have their own
  browsers.
- Solana's **Wallet Adapter** allows you to build websites that can request a
  user's wallet address and propose transactions for them to sign

## Lesson

### Wallets

In the previous two lessons, we discussed keypairs. Keypairs are used to locate
accounts and sign transactions. While the public key of a keypair is perfectly
safe to share, the secret key should always be kept in a secure location. If a
user's secret key is exposed, then a malicious actor could execute transactions
with the authority of that user, allowing them to transfer all the assets
inside.

A “wallet” refers to anything that stores a secret key to keep it secure. These
secure storage options can generally be described as either “hardware” or
“software” wallets. Hardware wallets are storage devices that are separate from
your computer. Software wallets are applications you can install on your
existing device(s).

- On mobile, software wallets are typically mobile apps, installed through the
  iOS App Store or Google Play. These include their own web browsers.
- On desktop, software wallets often come in the form of a browser extension.

Both techniques allow websites to interact easily with the wallet, for example:

1. Seeing the wallet's wallet address (their public key)
2. Submitting transactions for a user's approval to sign
3. Sending signed transactions to the network

Signing transactions requires using your secret key. By letting a site submit a
transaction to your wallet and having the wallet handle the signing, you ensure
that you never expose your secret key to the website. Instead, you only share
the secret key with the wallet application.

Unless you're creating a wallet application yourself, your code should never
need to ask a user for their secret key. Instead, you can ask users to connect
to your site using a reputable wallet.

## Solana's Wallet Adapter

If you build web apps, and need users to be able to connect to their wallets and
sign transactions through your apps, you'll want Solana's Wallet Adapter. Wallet
Adapter is a suite of modular packages:

- The core functionality is found in `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`.
- React support is added by `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`.
- Additional packages provide components for common UI frameworks. In this
  lesson, and throughout this course, we'll be using components from
  `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

Finally, some packages are adapters for specific wallet apps. These are now no
longer necessary in most cases - see below.

### Install Wallet-Adapter Libraries for React

When adding wallet support to an existing React app, you start by installing the
appropriate packages. You'll need `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`,
`@solana/wallet-adapter-react`. If you plan to use the provided React
components, you'll also need to add `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

All wallets that support the
[Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard) are
supported out of the box, and all the popular Solana wallets support the Wallet
Standard. However, if you wish to add support for any wallets that don't support
the standard, add a package for them.

```
npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-base \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui
```

<Callout type="note">
We're learning doing this manually to learn about Wallet
Adapter, but you can also use
[create-solana-dapp](https://github.com/solana-developers/create-solana-dapp) to
create a brand new React or NextJS app that supports Solana wallets.

### Connect To Wallets

`@solana/wallet-adapter-react` allows us to persist and access wallet connection
states through hooks and context providers, namely:

- `useWallet`
- `WalletProvider`
- `useConnection`
- `ConnectionProvider`

For these to work properly, any use of `useWallet` and `useConnection` should be
wrapped in `WalletProvider` and `ConnectionProvider`. One of the best ways to
ensure this is to wrap your entire app in `ConnectionProvider` and
`WalletProvider`:

```tsx
import { NextPage } from "next";
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionProvider,
  WalletProvider,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

export const Home: NextPage = props => {
  const endpoint = clusterApiUrl("devnet");
  const wallets = useMemo(() => [], []);

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets}>
        <p>Put the rest of your app here</p>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
};
```

Note that `ConnectionProvider` requires an `endpoint` property and that
`WalletProvider` requires a `wallets` property. We're continuing to use the
endpoint for the Devnet cluster, and since all major Solana wallet applications
support the Wallet Standard, we don't need any wallet-specific adapters. At this
point, you can connect with `wallet.connect()`, which will instruct the wallet
to prompt the user for permission to view their public key and request approval
for transactions.

![wallet connection prompt](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/wallet-connect-prompt.png)

While you could do this in a `useEffect` hook, you'll usually want to provide
more sophisticated functionality. For example, you may want users to be able to
choose from a list of supported wallet applications or disconnect after they've
already connected.

### @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui

You can create custom components for this, or you can leverage components
provided by `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`. The simplest way to provide a
full-featured wallet experience is to use `WalletModalProvider` and
`WalletMultiButton`:

```tsx
import { NextPage } from "next";
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionProvider,
  WalletProvider,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import {
  WalletModalProvider,
  WalletMultiButton,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";
import {
  clusterApiUrl,
  Transaction,
  PublicKey,
  SystemProgram,
} from "@solana/web3.js";

const Home: NextPage = props => {
  const endpoint = clusterApiUrl("devnet");
  const wallets = useMemo(() => [], []);

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets}>
        <WalletModalProvider>
          <WalletMultiButton />
          <p>Put the rest of your app here</p>
        </WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

The `WalletModalProvider` adds functionality for presenting a modal screen for
users to select which wallet they'd like to use. The `WalletMultiButton` changes
behavior to match the connection status:

![multi button select wallet option](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/multi-button-select-wallet.png)

![connect wallet modal](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/connect-wallet-modal.png)

![multi button connect options](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/multi-button-connect.png)

![multi button connected state](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/multi-button-connected.png)

You can also use more granular components if you need more specific
functionality:

- `WalletConnectButton`
- `WalletModal`
- `WalletModalButton`
- `WalletDisconnectButton`
- `WalletIcon`

### Access Account Info

Once your site is connected to a wallet, `useConnection` will retrieve a
`Connection` object and `useWallet` will get the `WalletContextState`.
`WalletContextState` has a property `publicKey` that is `null` when not
connected to a wallet and has the public key of the user's account when a wallet
is connected. With a public key and a connection, you can fetch account info and
more.

```tsx
import { useConnection, useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { FC, useEffect, useState } from "react";

export const BalanceDisplay: FC = () => {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(0);
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const { publicKey } = useWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    const updateBalance = async () => {
      if (!connection || !publicKey) {
        console.error("Wallet not connected or connection unavailable");
      }

      try {
        connection.onAccountChange(
          publicKey,
          updatedAccountInfo => {
            setBalance(updatedAccountInfo.lamports / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
          },
          "confirmed",
        );

        const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(publicKey);

        if (accountInfo) {
          setBalance(accountInfo.lamports / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
        } else {
          throw new Error("Account info not found");
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to retrieve account info:", error);
      }
    };

    updateBalance();
  }, [connection, publicKey]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{publicKey ? `Balance: ${balance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL} SOL` : ""}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Note the call to connection.onAccountChange(), which updates the account balance
shown once the network confirms the transaction.

### Send Transactions

`WalletContextState` also provides a `sendTransaction` function that you can use
to submit transactions for approval.

```tsx
const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet();
const { connection } = useConnection();

const sendSol = async event => {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (!publicKey) {
    console.error("Wallet not connected");
    return;
  }

  try {
    const recipientPubKey = new PublicKey(event.currentTarget.recipient.value);

    const transaction = new Transaction();
    const sendSolInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: publicKey,
      toPubkey: recipientPubKey,
      lamports: 0.1 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
    });

    transaction.add(sendSolInstruction);

    const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);
    console.log(`Transaction signature: ${signature}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Transaction failed", error);
  }
};
```

When this function is called, the connected wallet will display the transaction
for the user's approval. If approved, then the transaction will be sent.

![wallet transaction approval prompt](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/wallet-transaction-approval-prompt.png)

## Lab

Let's take the Ping program from the last lesson and build a frontend that lets
users approve a transaction that pings the program. As a reminder, the program's
public key is `ChT1B39WKLS8qUrkLvFDXMhEJ4F1XZzwUNHUt4AU9aVa` and the public key
for the data account is `Ah9K7dQ8EHaZqcAsgBW8w37yN2eAy3koFmUn4x3CJtod`.

### Download a Solana wallet

You'll need a Solana wallet app. There's a wide variety of
[Solana wallets](https://solana.com/docs/intro/wallets) available. We're going
to use a browser-extension wallet in this case, since you probably code on a
laptop or desktop!

Follow the wallets instructions for creating a new account and a new wallet.

Then set your wallet to use Devnet, for example:

- In Phantom, click **Settings** -> **Developer Settings** -> **Testnet mode**.
  'Testnet mode' sets Solana to Devnet by default.
- In Solflare, click **Settings** -> **General** -> **Network** -> **DevNet**
- In Backpack, click **Preferences** -> **Developer Mode**

This ensures that your wallet app will be connected to the same network we'll be
using in this lab.

### Download the starter code

<!-- TODO: this uses old Unboxed starter repos, we could move it to use `create-solana-dapp` eg https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-ping-frontend/tree/main/web -->

Download the
[starter code for this project](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-ping-frontend/tree/starter).
This project is a simple Next.js application. It's mostly empty except for the
`AppBar` component. We'll build the rest throughout this lab.

You can see its current state with the command `npm run dev` in the console.

### Wrap the app in context providers

To start, we're going to create a new component to contain the various
Wallet-Adapter providers that we'll be using. Create a new file inside the
`components` folder called `WalletContextProvider.tsx`.

Let's start with some of the boilerplate for a functional component:

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react";

const WalletContextProvider: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  return (

  ));
};

export default WalletContextProvider;
```

To properly connect to the user's wallet, we'll need a `ConnectionProvider`,
`WalletProvider`, and `WalletModalProvider`. Start by importing these components
from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` and `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`. Then
add them to the `WalletContextProvider` component. Note that
`ConnectionProvider` requires an `endpoint` parameter and `WalletProvider`
requires an array of `wallets`. For now, just use an empty string and an empty
array, respectively.

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionProvider,
  WalletProvider,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { WalletModalProvider } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";

const WalletContextProvider: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={""}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={[]}>
        <WalletModalProvider>{children}</WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
};

export default WalletContextProvider;
```

The last things we need are an actual endpoint for `ConnectionProvider` and the
supported wallets for `WalletProvider`.

For the endpoint, we'll use the same `clusterApiUrl` function from the
`@solana/web3.js` library that we've used before so you'll need to import it.
For the array of wallets you'll also need to import the
`@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets` library.

After importing these libraries, create a constant `endpoint` that uses the
`clusterApiUrl` function to get the URL for Devnet. Then create a constant named
`wallets` and set it to an empty array - since all wallets support Wallet
Standard, we no longer need any custom wallet adapter. Finally, replace the
empty string and empty array in `ConnectionProvider` and `WalletProvider`,
respectively.

To complete this component, add
`require('@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css');` below your imports to
ensure proper styling and behavior of the Wallet Adapter library components.

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionProvider,
  WalletProvider,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { WalletModalProvider } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";
import * as walletAdapterWallets from "@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets";
require("@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css");

const WalletContextProvider: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const endpoint = clusterApiUrl("devnet");
  const wallets = useMemo(() => [], []);

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets}>
        <WalletModalProvider>{children}</WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
};

export default WalletContextProvider;
```

### Add wallet multi-button

Next, let's set up the Connect button. The current button is just a placeholder
because rather than using a standard button or creating a custom component,
we'll be using Wallet-Adapter's “multi-button.” This button interfaces with the
providers we set up in `WalletContextProvider` and let's users choose a wallet,
connect to a wallet, and disconnect from a wallet. If you ever need more custom
functionality, you can create a custom component to handle this.

Before we add the “multi-button,” we need to wrap the app in the
`WalletContextProvider`. Do this by importing it in `index.tsx` and adding it
after the closing `</Head>` tag:

```tsx
import { NextPage } from "next";
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";
import WalletContextProvider from "../components/WalletContextProvider";
import { AppBar } from "../components/AppBar";
import Head from "next/head";
import { PingButton } from "../components/PingButton";

const Home: NextPage = props => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.App}>
      <Head>
        <title>Wallet-Adapter Example</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Wallet-Adapter Example" />
      </Head>
      <WalletContextProvider>
        <AppBar />
        <div className={styles.AppBody}>
          <PingButton />
        </div>
      </WalletContextProvider>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

If you run the app, everything should still look the same since the current
button on the top right is still just a placeholder. To remedy this, open
`AppBar.tsx` and replace `<button>Connect</button>` with `<WalletMultiButton/>`.
You'll need to import `WalletMultiButton` from
`@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

```tsx
import { FC } from "react";
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";
import Image from "next/image";
import { WalletMultiButton } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";

export const AppBar: FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.AppHeader}>
      <Image src="/solanaLogo.png" height={30} width={200} />
      <span>Wallet-Adapter Example</span>
      <WalletMultiButton />
    </div>
  );
};
```

At this point, you should be able to run the app and interact with the
multi-button at the top-right of the screen. It should now read, "Select
Wallet." If you have the a wallet installed, you should be able to use this
button to connect your wallet to the site.

### Create button to ping program

Now that our app can connect to our wallet, let's make the “Ping!” button
actually do something.

Start by opening the `PingButton.tsx` file. We're going to replace the
`console.log` inside of `onClick` with code that will create a transaction and
submit it to the wallet app for the end user's approval.

First, we need a connection, the wallet's public key, and Wallet-Adapter's
`sendTransaction` function. To get this, we need to import `useConnection` and
`useWallet` from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`. While we're here, let's also
import `@solana/web3.js` since we'll need it to create our transaction.

```tsx
import { useConnection, useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import {
  PublicKey,
  Transaction,
  TransactionInstruction,
  sendTransaction,
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import { FC, useState } from "react";
import styles from "../styles/PingButton.module.css";

export const PingButton: FC = () => {
  const onClick = () => {
    console.log("Ping!");
  };

  return (
    <div className={styles.buttonContainer} onClick={onClick}>
      <button className={styles.button}>Ping!</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now use the `useConnection` hook to create a `connection` constant and the
`useWallet` hook to create `publicKey` and `sendTransaction` constants.

```tsx
import { useConnection, useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import {
  PublicKey,
  Transaction,
  TransactionInstruction,
  sendTransaction,
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import { FC, useState } from "react";
import styles from "../styles/PingButton.module.css";

export const PingButton: FC = () => {
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet();

  const onClick = () => {
    console.log("Ping!");
  };

  return (
    <div className={styles.buttonContainer} onClick={onClick}>
      <button className={styles.button}>Ping!</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

With that, we can fill in the body of `onClick`.

First, check that both `connection` and `publicKey` exist (if either does not
then the user's wallet isn't connected yet).

Next, construct two instances of `PublicKey`, one for the program ID
`ChT1B39WKLS8qUrkLvFDXMhEJ4F1XZzwUNHUt4AU9aVa` and one for the data account
`Ah9K7dQ8EHaZqcAsgBW8w37yN2eAy3koFmUn4x3CJtod`.

Next, construct a `Transaction`, then a new `TransactionInstruction` that
includes the data account as a writable key.

Next, add this instruction to the transaction.

Finally, call `sendTransaction`.

```tsx
const onClick = async () => {
  if (!connection || !publicKey) {
    console.error("Wallet not connected or connection unavailable");
  }

  try {
    const programId = new PublicKey(PROGRAM_ID);
    const programDataAccount = new PublicKey(DATA_ACCOUNT_PUBKEY);
    const transaction = new Transaction();

    const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
      keys: [
        {
          pubkey: programDataAccount,
          isSigner: false,
          isWritable: true,
        },
      ],
      programId,
    });

    transaction.add(instruction);

    const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);
    console.log("Transaction Signature:", signature);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Transaction failed:", error);
  }
};
```

And that's it! If you refresh the page, connect your wallet, and click the ping
button, your wallet should present you with a popup to confirm the transaction.

### Add some polish

There's a lot you could do to make the user experience here even better. For
example, you could change the UI to only show you the Ping button when a wallet
is connected and display some other prompt otherwise. You could link to the
transaction on Solana Explorer after a user confirms a transaction so they can
easily go look at the transaction details. The more you experiment with it, the
more comfortable you'll get, so get creative!

You can also download the
[full source code from this lab](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-ping-frontend)
to understand all of this in context.

## Challenge

Now it's your turn to build something independently. Create an application that
lets a user connect their wallet and send SOL to another account.

![Send SOL App](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/solana-send-sol-app.png)

1. You can build this from scratch or you can
   [download the starter code](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-send-sol-frontend/tree/starter).
2. Wrap the starter application in the appropriate context providers.
3. In the form component, set up the transaction and send it to the user's
   wallet for approval.
4. Get creative with the user experience. Add a link to let the user view the
   transaction on Solana Explorer or something else that seems cool to you!
