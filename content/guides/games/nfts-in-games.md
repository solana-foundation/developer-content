Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are rapidly gaining popularity as a means of
integrating Solana into games. These unique digital assets are stored on the
Solana blockchain and come with a JSON metadata attached to them. The metadata
allows developers to store important attributes and information about the NFT,
such as its rarity or specific in-game capabilities. NFTs can be used in games
to represent anything from weapons and armor to digital real estate and
collectibles, providing a new level of ownership and scarcity for players.
Furthermore NFTs can be representing land, houses, achievements or even
characters in a game. The possibilities are endless.

## Using Solana GameShift to create NFTs

Solana GameShift is a gaming API maintained by
[Solana Labs](https://solanalabs.com/) which lets you easily create NFTs and
other assets for your game. GameShift offers these features:

- A simple API to create NFTs
- Buying assets via USD onramp
- In game market place
- Updating metadata of NFTs

- [Docs](https://docs.gameshift.dev/)
- [Example Game Live](https://solplay.de/cubeshift)
- [Example Game Source](https://github.com/solana-developers/cube_shift)
- [Example Game dev log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCPXVn14TY)

## Token gating with NFTs

Using NFTs, you can gate access to a particular part of a game based on owning
the NFT. This can form a more tight-knit community within your game. In
[JS](https://docs.solana.com/de/developing/clients/javascript-api) using the
[Metaplex SDK](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js#readme) this would look
like this:

```js
JSON.parse(
  // For example '~/.config/solana/devnet.json'
  fs.readFileSync("yourKeyPair.json").toString())
);
let keyPair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(decodedKey);

const metaplex = Metaplex.make(connection).use(keypairIdentity(keyPair));

const nfts = await metaplex
  .nfts()
  .findAllByOwner({ owner: wallet.publicKey })

let collectionNfts = []
for (let i = 0; i < nfts.length; i++) {
  if (nfts[i].collection?.address.toString() == collectionAddress.toString()) {
    collectionNfts.push(nfts[i])
  }
}
```

Another performant way to load NFTs is the
[DAS asset API](https://docs.helius.dev/compression-and-das-api/digital-asset-standard-das-api).
You can see an example of this in the solana games preset in the js client:
[Code Example](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana_game_preset/blob/main/app/components/DisplayNfts.tsx)

```bash
npx create-solana-game your-game-name
```

## Bonus Effects with NFTs

In addition to providing new revenue streams, NFTs can also be used to provide
in-game benefits and bonuses to players. For instance, a player who owns a "coin
doubler" NFT may receive double the amount of coins for as long as they hold the
NFT in their wallet. Additionally, NFTs can be used as consumables, allowing
players to use them to gain temporary effects such as potions or spells. Once
consumed, the NFT is burned, and the effect is applied to the player's
character. These innovative features of NFTs provide game developers with new
opportunities to create unique gameplay experiences and reward players for their
ownership of valuable assets on the Solana blockchain.

[How to interact with tokens](/content/guides/games/interact-with-tokens.md)

In the game Seven Seas there are for example three tokens. Pirate coins, which
are used to upgrade ships, rum which increases the health of ships and cannons
which increase ships damage.

- [Source](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-game-examples/tree/main/seven-seas)
- [Eight Hour video boot camp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLilwLeBwGuK6NsYMPP_BlVkeQgff0NwvU)

You can also use
[Dynamic metadata](/content/guides/games/interact-with-tokens.md) to save
character level and experience or items in an NFT. Like this game NFTs could
become more valuable the more the players play with them.

You can also do this with Metaplex's new
[Core NFT standard](https://developers.metaplex.com/core).

## Using NFT Metadata for Player Stats

NFTs also have Metadata, which can be used for all kind of traits for game
objects. For example an NFT could represent a game character and their traits
(Strength, Intelligence, Agility, etc) could directly influence how strong the
character is in the game. You can load NFT metadata and their attributes using
the Metaplex SDK:

```js
import { Metaplex, keypairIdentity } from "@metaplex-foundation/js";

JSON.parse(
  // For example '.config/solana/devnet.json'
  fs.readFileSync("yourKeyPair.json").toString())
);
let keyPair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(decodedKey);

const metaplex = Metaplex.make(connection).use(keypairIdentity(keyPair));
const nfts = await metaplex.nfts().findAllByOwner({owner: keyPair.publicKey});

const physicalDamage = 5;
const magicalDamage = 5;

nfts.forEach(async nft => {
  const metaData = await metaplex.nfts().load({metadata: nft});

    metaData.json.attributes.forEach(async attribute => {
      if (attribute.trait_type == "Strength") {
        physicalDamage += parseInt(attribute.value)
      }
      if (attribute.trait_type == "Int") {
        magicalDamage += parseInt(attribute.value)
      }
    });
})

console.log("Player Physical Damage: " + physicalDamage)
console.log("Player Magical Damage: " + magicalDamage)
```

## Use NFTs to save a game state

You can also use the mint of an NFT to derive a PDA and use that PDA to save the
game state of a player. This way you can save the game state of a player in a
NFT and the player can take it with him and sell it for example. You can see how
that can be done in the
[Solana 2048 game](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-2048) for
example:

```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = signer,
    space = 800,
    seeds = [b"player".as_ref(), nftMint.key().as_ref()],
    bump,
)]
pub player: Account<'info, PlayerData>,
```

## Fusing NFTs Together

The
[Metaplex Fusion Trifle program](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/fusion/overview)
allows you to have NFTs own other NFTs. For example you could create a plant
plot NFT and then use to combine it with a water NFT and a seed NFT to create a
Tomato NFT.

## Use 3D NFTs in a game

Every NFT metadata can also have a animation url. This url can contain a video,
GIF or a 3D file. These 3D files usually use the format `.glb` or `.gltf` and
can dynamically be loaded into a game. For unity you can use the
[GLTFast](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast) package and in JS the
[GLTFast JS](https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/load-models/). For
reference a
[NFT metadata with glb model](https://solscan.io/token/DzHPvbGzrHK4UcyeDurw2nuBFKNvt4Kb7K8Bx9dtsfn#metadata)

```c#
var gltf = gameObject.AddComponent<GLTFast.GltfAsset>();
gltf.url = nft.metadata.animationUrl;
```

```js
npm install --save-dev gltf-loader-ts

import { GltfLoader } from 'gltf-loader-ts';

let loader = new GltfLoader();
let uri = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/BoxTextured/glTF/BoxTextured.gltf';
let asset: Asset = await loader.load(uri);
let gltf: GlTf = asset.gltf;
console.log(gltf);
// -> {asset: {…}, scene: 0, scenes: Array(1), nodes: Array(2), meshes: Array(1), …}

let data = await asset.accessorData(0); // fetches BoxTextured0.bin
let image: Image = await asset.imageData.get(0) // fetches CesiumLogoFlat.png
```

## Customize NFTs with items and traits (Raindrops boots)

With the [Raindrops Boots program](https://docs.raindrops.xyz/services/boots)
you can have an adventure character which owns a sword and a helmet. When the
Character NFT would be sold on a market place the other NFTs it owns would be
sold as well.

## How to create NFTs in a program and add additional metadata

With the new Token extensions it is possible to create NFTs in a program and
also add additional dynamic traits that can be saved in the NFT mint itself. You
can for example save experience and player level in the NFT itself. These NFTs
could become more valuable the more the players play with them. A player 99
character maybe more desirable than a level 1 character.

## How to create an NFT collection

NFTs on Solana mostly follow the Metaplex standard. Metaplex is a company that
takes care of the most-used NFT standard on Solana. The most common way to
create an NFT collection is to create a Metaplex candy machine which lets the
user mint predefined pairs of metadata and images.

The most used NFT standard on Solana is
[Metaplex](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/how-to-guides/my-first-candy-machine-part1)

In the
[Metaplex Community guides](https://developers.metaplex.com/community-guides)
you can find help setting up your NFT collection.

But there are many more NFT standards on Solana:

- spNFTs
- WNS
- Core
- SPL-22
- SPL-404
- nifty

You can find some more information about these here:
[NFT standards list](https://twitter.com/blessed_burgers/status/1776626530921206087)

## NFT Staking and missions

You can stake NFTs to for example create in-game currency or send NFTs on
missions to give the players rewards.
[Honeycomb Protocol](https://docs.honeycombprotocol.com/) for example offers
these functionality and more.
