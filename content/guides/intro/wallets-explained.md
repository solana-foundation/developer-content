In this article, I will take you out of the rabbit hole. We will, together, put
back the pieces of all the blockchain concepts by uncovering the true purpose of
wallets.

Hint: Wallets are not here to show your losses in a bear market 😅, they are
here to access the blockchain and build!

## Puzzle Piece 1: The Balance Myth

🤫 Tell you a secret, wallets are misleading. They do not store your crypto. In
fact, they do not hold anything. So why do we need even them in dapps and
blockchain?

![A screenshot of a wallet balance](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---1-Phantom-Balance.png)

Skeptical? Take a look at
[this account's balance](https://explorer.solana.com/address/E35325pbtxCRsA4uVoC3cyBDZy8BMpmxvsvGcHNUa18k?cluster=devnet).
If my crypto were stored inside a wallet, how come you can just look up what's
inside my wallet on the Internet?

Why am I starting to talk about wallet balance? You may ask. Because the
"wallet" term is misleading! For a casual crypto holder, that notion of token
storage might be enough. But as devs, this does not make sense at all. So let's
debunk all the myths about wallets by investigating how data and balances are
stored.

Your wallet balance is stored on the blockchain, not inside your Phantom app,
not inside your nano ledger. So it is just data that you can query from the
blockchain, and anyone can see it!

Earlier,
[I used the Solana explorer to check my wallet SOL balance](https://explorer.solana.com/address/E35325pbtxCRsA4uVoC3cyBDZy8BMpmxvsvGcHNUa18k?cluster=devnet).
We can retrieve data about a wallet by identifying it by its public key.

Let's update our definition of wallets:

- A wallet can be identified by a public key (its address).
- A wallet balance is just data stored on the blockchain.

## Puzzle Piece 2: Blockchain

Let's continue to unroll the thread. We have established that balance is stored
on the blockchain and not inside your computer. The next exciting trail we could
follow is to ask ourselves how data, in general, is stored in the blockchain.

**To understand why we need wallets, we first need to understand how data is
stored in blockchains.**

_But first, let's take a step back and compare how data is stored in a web2
world:_

![A diagram showing how data is stored in traditional systems](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---5-Web2.png)

In web2, your data is siloed inside a company's server, and the data is handled
by the company. So if tomorrow they decide to delete for censorship or
mistakenly destroy your data, it can happen! (That's not a pro blockchain
comment, it is just a fact 😅).

_Now, let's compare it to how data is stored in a blockchain:_

![A diagram showing how data is stored on a blockchain](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---6-Web3.png)

**A blockchain is a distributed ledger:**

1. A blockchain is not one single thing. It is a swarm of servers, like 🐝
2. Altogether, these servers represent "a blockchain," like a beehive 👁‍🗨
3. These servers belong to no one or rather anyone.
4. Anyone can be part of the blockchain, and you can use your grandma's laptop
   as one of these servers.
5. All the nodes store a copy of the data.

> Actually, your grandma's hardware is not probably gonna cut it, but you got my
> point!

💡 **Think**

- Does a blockchain necessarily need to be on the Internet?
- What is the problem with sharing data with anyone?

## Puzzle Piece 3: Signing

If we recap what we just learned about blockchains, all nodes contain a copy of
your data. I don't know for you, but something is bugging me here...

**It means anyone from your best friend to your worse enemy can use their
computer to make a node and thus own your data!**

Since data is shared by everyone, how do we avoid anarchy and people modifying
other people's data or cheating the system:

- If an Instagram Clone were built on the blockchain, you would not want anyone
  to start modifying or deleting your photos, would you?
- Or, if we were making a Paypal version on the blockchain, how do we make sure
  that someone doesn't withdraw money from your account? After all, the data
  (balance) is duplicated and spread between everyone.

Let's take the example of a wallet balance, this time we gonna zoom inside a
blockchain node:

![An image showing a simplified version of a transactions stored on a ledger](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---8-A-node-s-Dairy.png)

Let's say we have 3 protagonists, Claire, Jay, and Brian. Claire happily sends 5
SOL to both Jay and Brian. But Brian (the evil guy in my story) wants more than
5 SOL. So he pretends to be Claire and asks the blockchain to send an additional
10 SOL to himself.

**What actually prevents him from doing this?**

If we were doing web2, you would be saying, well, we can check if the user is
signed in, and if they are signed in, we can check if the balance's owner is
indeed the user; there are two problems:

1. There is no "session"; the blockchain does not track who is currently "signed
   in."
2. Earlier, when we verified the wallet balance, we used the wallet public key;
   the public key is, well ...public; you could use my public key and pretend to
   be me.

**Enough teasing. What's the solution?**

![An image showing a simplified version of a transactions stored on a ledger](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---8.1-A-node-s-dairy.png)

Yes! The key is signing using the secret key! We can "password protect our data"
without communicating the password, thanks to asymmetric cryptography magic.

What's asymmetric? _Think SSH keys_.

Can't wrap your head around it? Well, just think about the real world. For
example, if a malicious imposter wants to withdraw money from your bank account,
he would need your signature to do it. Well, that's precisely the same here: any
modification to data identified by a public key also needs to be signed by the
corresponding secret key.

Yes, there was a world like that when mobile banking did not exist.

**That's the true nature of wallets!! They are here to sign access to data. They
are signatures or stamps.**

That's a whole different paradigm here. In web2, authentication and
authorization were handled by the server. While in web3, this is done directly
by cryptography with keys in your own hand!

Congrats! You discovered the nature of trustless and decentralized systems.

## Puzzle Piece 4: Transaction

We just uncovered the true nature of wallets just above. But what exactly do we
sign? Secret keys are used to sign transactions. A transaction is how we can ask
a blockchain to do something.

And the good thing for us is that blockchains are all ears to receive orders.
Grossly speaking, a blockchain, or more precisely a blockchain node, stores logs
or journals. They contain a very long list of orders (transactions). These
transactions all together represent the state of the world. That's why we call
blockchain state machines:

- Maverick sends 10 SOL to Iceman.
- Claire sends 5 SOL to Laura.
- Michael B. buys Wakanda NFT.

> Blockchain actually stores a chain of blocks. Transactions are bundled into
> blocks. But that's a story for another time.

How do permission and signing actually work? Let's say Brian tries to
impersonate Claire to send himself some extra SOL from Claire's wallet
(Remember? Wallet Addresses are public).

![A diagram showing the lifecycle of a transaction](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---9-Transaction.png)

> Solana can do much more than **Transfer** Tokens, but the same logic applies
> to every action, especially for modifying data, where you need to prove that
> you have the permission to do so. Thus you need to sign that action
> **(transaction)**.

💡 **Think**

- When do we need to sign transactions?
- And when do we not need to sign?

**... (don't look below before trying!)**

- _We need to sign when we mutate data. If we create or change data, we are
  supposed to have the authority to do so._
- _We do not need to sign when just reading data._

## Puzzle Piece 5: Wallet Apps

And finally, to complete the circle, let's talk about wallet apps such as
[Phantom](https://phantom.app/) or [Solflare](https://solflare.com/). As you now
understand, the secret sauce to the world of blockchain is really about the
public key and the signing using the secret key.

Wallets Apps are really just apps regardless of if it is a mobile wallet, a
browser extension, or a desktop app, it really is just an app.

These apps just wrap around your keys and add UX niceties such as:

- Storing your secret key encrypted and with a password lock.
- Adding a recovery passphrase to restore the key.
- Fetching data from the blockchain to display your wallet's balance.
- Letting you swap a token by connecting with exchanges.
- Etc.

_An example of how the recovery and balance feature work:_

![A diagram showing an example of how the recovery and balance features on a wallet work](/assets/guides/wallets-explained/Wallets---10-Wallet-Apps.png)

As you can see, the essential data live in the blockchain. Wallets are just
convenience vaults that store your secret key encrypted. This is just standard
industry encryption and has nothing to do with the blockchain. The most
important feature it provides really is signing using the secret key.

## Putting things back in order

1. Data is stored in a swarm of servers (nodes); these validators form the
   blockchain.
2. Everyone can be a validator node. For this reason, data can be accessed by
   anyone.
3. Changes in a blockchain happen with directives: instructions/transactions.
4. To avoid chaos, we need a way to determine who can change what: this is where
   signing comes into play.
5. Thanks to cryptography, we can sign a transaction (change) using a
   public/secret key pair: this stamp (or signature) allows us to "password
   lock" some data without communicating the password to the world.
6. A blockchain is a state machine that stores an infinite list of records,
   logs, or journals of every transaction. The blockchain verifies access to
   data by checking a transaction signature.
7. **That's why wallets exist! To authenticate and authorize access by signing
   with a secret key!**
8. A wallet is purely a convenience we created to wrap the secret key and add
   niceties such as; securely storing the secret key (with a password lock) or
   showing the token account balance. So yes, wallets store an encrypted version
   of your secret key.
9. You can totally interact with the blockchain without a wallet app like
   Solflare or Phantom! It would just be a harrowing user experience. ;)

_So here you have it, public/secret key pairs provide a way for the blockchain
to identify you and make sure you got the permission to do what you claim you
should be able to do!_

**Wallets are called wallets because the first usage was to lock your balance
historically. But in the on-chain program world, it is still about locking your
data, not just balances. If anything, wallets should really be called stamps or
signature pens! ✍️.**

## What's Next?

Do you want to start building on Solana?

- A gentle introduction to Solana:

- Tutorials: [https://soldev.app/](https://soldev.app/)

### Blockchain and block chain

- At 10000 feet, blockchain in the macro term is a swarm of servers, validators
  nodes.
- At 100 feet, a blockchain node contains a chain of blocks.
- At 1 mm, a block bundles a list of transactions/instructions
- Back to 10000 feet, a blockchain is a swarm of nodes that synchronize their
  chain of blocks.

The term blockchain originates from the invention of blocks that are chained
together. But in general, when we say blockchain, we think about the whole swarm
of nodes, because everyone is supposed to be a copy of another node. So they are
all the same.

### Accounts

I haven't mentioned precisely how data are stored. In the Solana world,
everything is stored in accounts. If Linux stores data into files, Solana stores
data into accounts like a file system. While files have a filename, accounts
have a public address:

- So your SOL balance is actually stored in an account whose public address is
  your public key!  
  Modification access to that account is locked by the corresponding secret key
  signature!

### Authentication

When you connect your wallet to a dapp. What does connecting a wallet really do?
You are not "connecting" anything, actually. It just gives your public key to
the dapp. As we said earlier, to prove that you own the public key, the dapp
needs to ask you to sign a message. You probably have seen this in some dapps,
where you would have two popups:

- One for connecting the wallet.
- Another one to sign a message.
