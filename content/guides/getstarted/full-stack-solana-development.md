This guide will walk you through building a full-stack Solana dApp using React
and Anchor. A walkthrough video is available
[here](https://youtu.be/vUHF1X48zM4).

If you've never used Solana and don't know what a blockchain is, you can also
checkout [this crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH60e4gZBSY) to get
you up to speed with the basics.

If any words or terms in this guide are confusing you, check out the
[terminology](/docs/terminology.md) page on the Solana docs, they're pretty
good!

> The final code for this guide can be found in
> [this repository](https://github.com/AlmostEfficient/full-stack-solana-dev).

## Project overview

We'll be building a full-stack Solana app using these tools:

- Anchor - program for building Solana programs in Rust
- Solana CLI - command line interface for interacting with Solana
- React - front-end framework
- wallet-adapter - library for connecting wallets to your app

### What you will learn

- How to build a Solana program in Rust using Anchor
- Testing Anchor programs
- Deploying to the Solana devnet
- Building a React app that interacts with Solana from scratch
- Connecting your React app to your Solana program

### Environment setup

To begin, you'll need to set up your environment. This guide assumes you're
running MacOS or Linux. If you're on Windows, you'll need to install WSL and use
that instead,
[here's how](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Here's a list of the tools you'll need to have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](/docs/intro/installation)
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

You can download Node and Yarn from their setup pages which I've linked above.
For the rest, check out the
[Solana Local development guide](/docs/intro/installation) which has detailed
instructions for different operating systems.

**We'll be using Anchor 0.29 for this guide**. You can make sure you're using it
with `avm use 0.29.0`.

Once you have everything installed, run this command:

```shell
solana --version; node -v; yarn --version; anchor --version
```

<Callout type="caution" title="Windows Users">

Make sure you're running a WSL terminal, not a Windows terminal.

</Callout>

You should see a number of versions printed out. If you get an error, you'll
need to install the missing tool.

If you haven't set up a Solana wallet yet, you can do that with:

```shell
solana-keygen new
```

You'll be prompted to enter a passphrase. This is the password you'll use to
sign transactions and interact with your wallet. I only use my wallet for
development, so I left mine blank.

The last thing you'll need is a Solana browser wallet extension to interact with
the web-app you build. Some popular wallets you could use are:
[Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Solflare](https://solflare.com/), and
[Backpack](https://backpack.app/).

## Write and deploy a Solana program

We'll start with our Solana Program (sometimes called a smart contract). This is
Rust code that will live on the Solana blockchain that we'll be interacting
with. To speed things up, we'll first deploy our program to a local Solana
network running on our machine. Configure your Solana CLI to localnet like this:

```shell
solana config set --url localhost
```

Now we need to set up the local validator. Open up a new terminal window and run
these commands:

```shell
cd ~
solana-test-validator
```

(Windows users -- `solana-test-validator` only works in the `~` directory.)

You'll see a bunch of logs that look like this:

```shell
endgame@~>solana-test-validator
Ledger location: test-ledger
Log: test-ledger/validator.log
⠈ Initializing...
Waiting for fees to stabilize 1...
Identity: 4GrmBaUtMM4CEKBDkwwne9AAVH9gzfqcoqm1Xwj3BfgT

TPU Address: 127.0.0.1:1027

⠉ 00:02:13 | Processed Slot: 321 | Confirmed Slot: 321 | Finalized Slot: 289 | Full Snapshot Slot: 200 | Incremental Snapshot Slot
```

Nice! You have an entire Solana network running on your machine. Keep this
terminal window open -- if you close it this local network shuts down. This
local network automatically airdrops 500000000 SOL to your CLI address by
default. Just for fun, let's airdrop some more.

Open a new terminal window and run these:

```shell
solana airdrop 100
solana balance
```

You should now see `500000100 SOL`! This is enough for anything you can imagine.
When working with other clusters (like the devnet or testnet), you'll start with
0 SOL. It's important to use your SOL carefully and only airdrop when your
balance is low.

Alright, let's write some code!

### Set up an Anchor project

Anchor is a framework for building Solana programs. It reduces the amount of
boilerplate code you need to write and adds a lot of useful features like type
safety and testing. In your workspace, run these to create a new Anchor project
called `counter` and navigate into it:

```shell
anchor init counter
cd counter
```

Our program code will live in `programs/counter/src`. We'll interact and test
this program using tests in `tests/counter.ts` powered by Mocha/Chai. You can
ignore everything else in here for now.

The most common flow in developing programs on Solana is:

- write program in Rust
- build program to check for errors (or use
  [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
  to get real-time errors)
- write Mocha/Chai tests to make sure it does what you expect
- test program
- repeat until you're ready to deploy

Anchor projects come with everything we need to deploy out of the box. Run this
to build the program:

```shell
anchor build
```

This may take a minute on older machines the first time you run it. This command
compiles the Rust code in `programs/counter/src` to a program binary that can be
deployed to the Solana blockchain. You'll see a new `counter/target` folder has
appeared in your project. All the artifacts generated for your program are in
there. Once the command finishes running, you'll see this:

```shell
   Compiling counter v0.1.0 (/mnt/full-stack-solana-dev/counter/programs/counter)
warning: unused variable: `ctx`
 --> programs/counter/src/lib.rs:9:23
  |
9 |     pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
  |                       ^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_ctx`
  |
  = note: `#[warn(unused_variables)]` on by default

warning: `counter` (lib) generated 1 warning (run `cargo fix --lib -p counter` to apply 1 suggestion)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 4m 43s
```

You just built a Solana program! The output here is from the Rust compiler. If
there's any errors, warning, or other issues with your code, you'll see them
here.

Open up `programs/counter/src/lib.rs` and take a look at the code you just
built:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Bims5KmWhFne1m1UT4bfSknBEoECeYfztoKrsR2jTnrA");

#[program]
pub mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

The first line is bringing in the `anchor_lang` Rust library, similar to a
`import` statement in Javascript. Next we have a `declare_id!` Rust macro.
Macros in Rust are code that writes other code. Anchor generates a keypair for
your program, the ID here is the public key of that keypair.

Once Solana programs have been deployed to the network, they need to be
"initialized". This setup step is important because it sets initial state that
the program logic will depend on. It also assigns ownership of accounts to the
program, ensuring that the program has control over its state. Think of it
setting up a new office before you can begin business.

This is a Solana program that does only one thing: it initializes. Once that's
done, it exits. It doesn't do anything in the initialization step here.

You'll find the included test for this program in `tests/counter.ts`:

```ts filename="tests/counter.ts"
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Counter } from "../target/types/counter";

describe("counter", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  anchor.setProvider(anchor.AnchorProvider.env());

  const program = anchor.workspace.Counter as Program<Counter>;

  it("Is initialized!", async () => {
    // Add your test here.
    const tx = await program.methods.initialize().rpc();
    console.log("Your transaction signature", tx);
  });
});
```

If you haven't used Mocha before, this might seem unfamiliar. `describe` is used
to group related tests in a test suite and `it` is used to define individual
test cases. Anchor makes interacting with programs really easy by giving us a
nice API.

Here's what the Anchor stuff is:

- `AnchorProvider` lets us connect to our configured Solana development
  environment (local-test-validator).
- `const program = anchor.workspace.Counter` creates a reference to the program
  we just built.
- `as Program<Counter>` casts the program to the type in the IDL generated by
  Anchor when we built the program.
- `program.methods` gives us access to the methods we defined in our program.
- `initialize().rpc()` sends an RPC call with the `initialize` method.

Running this test with `anchor test --skip-local-validator` should give you:

```shell
  counter
Your transaction signature 2pMJRoC2h3AmCpfHQaptKTWV7Hyfuc2Gujfzrv6cffRhjptcuPbpMgahgrxtw28kRQ5Gf4d5VdMcon4j9aEmPyVy
    ✔ Is initialized! (325ms)

  1 passing (330ms)

Done in 12.65s.
```

When running tests, Anchor automatically sets up a local validator. Since we
already have one running, we can tell it to skip that step and use our one with
the `--skip-local-validator` flag.

### Write a counter program in Rust

Ready to write your first program? We'll be building a simple program that
increments a counter and returns the current value.

Before we can get started, delete your `counter/target` folder to start from a
clean slate. When you run `anchor build`, it does a lot of things behind the
scenes, including generating a keypair for your program, which is stored in
`counter/target/deploy/counter-keypair.json`.

Deleting the `target` folder will remove all artifacts for the previous program,
including the keypair used to deploy it. This means you will lose control of any
programs previously deployed (we don't care about the template program so it's
okay).

We're ready, let's make a counter! Open up `programs/counter/src/lib.rs` and
replace it with this:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

// Specify the program address
declare_id!("C93fyDjEmyAfr9nwDeWMVCeWVVx8fjySxnshSA9VY4KG");

// Instructions defined in program module
#[program]
pub mod counter {
    use super::*;

    // Instruction to initialize a new counter account
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        // Reference to the counter account from the Initialize struct
        let counter = &ctx.accounts.counter;
        msg!("Counter account created! Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }

    // Instruction to increment a counter account
    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {
        // Mutable reference to the counter account from the Increment struct
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        msg!("Previous counter: {}", counter.count);

        // Increment the count value stored on the counter account by 1
        counter.count = counter.count.checked_add(1).unwrap();
        msg!("Counter incremented! Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }
}

// Accounts required by the initialize instruction
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    // The account paying to create the counter account
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>, // specify account must be signer on the transaction

    // The counter account being created and initialized in the instruction
    #[account(
        init,         // specifies we are creating this account
        payer = user, // specifies account paying for the creation of the account
        space = 8 + 8 // space allocated to the new account (8 byte discriminator + 8 byte for u64)
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>, // specify account is 'Counter' type
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>, // specify account must be System Program
}

// Account required by the increment instruction
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment<'info> {
    #[account(mut)] // specify account is mutable because we are updating its data
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>, // specify account is 'Counter' type
}

// Define structure of `Counter` account
#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub count: u64, // define count value type as u64
}
```

The layout of this program is:

- import necessary Rust librarie
  s
- declare the program's address
- define program instruction handlers (functional logic)
- define structs for the instruction handlers (the data format that will be
  passed in)
- define structs for the accounts this program needs (including the format of
  the data stored on-chain)

The code here is simpler than it looks. Let's go block by block through the new
stuff.

```rust filename="lib.rs"
// Instructions defined in program module
#[program]
pub mod counter {
    use super::*;

    // Instruction to initialize a new counter account
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        // Reference to the counter account from the Initialize struct
        let counter = &ctx.accounts.counter;
        msg!("Counter account created! Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }

    // Instruction to increment a counter account
    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {
        // Mutable reference to the counter account from the Increment struct
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        msg!("Previous counter: {}", counter.count);

        // Increment the count value stored on the counter account by 1
        counter.count = counter.count.checked_add(1).unwrap();
        msg!("Counter incremented! Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

In the program module, we've got two instruction handlers - these are like the
endpoints of an API. Every time we call them via a transaction sent to an RPC,
we pass in some context (`ctx`) - the state of the blockchain, which accounts
are interacting with it, any data passed in, etc. Think of this like the body of
a POST request.

Both of these instruction handlers take in arguments that have specific formats
which we define later on and they return a `Result` type, which is a way to
handle responses/errors in Rust (kind of like a HTTP response code).

`let counter = &ctx.accounts.counter;` creates an immutable reference using the
value `counter` passed in from the context. For this program, we'll be
generating a keypair and passing in its address as the `counter` parameter. This
will make more sense when we look at the test.

The `msg!` is a print statement that we can see on the logs in our blockchain
explorer.

The `increment` instruction handler obtains a mutable reference to the counter
account from the context passed in. After logging the current value with a
`msg!` statement, it uses the `checked_add` method to increment the value by 1.
`unwrap` gives us the result of the operation (this would fail the transaction
if the addition overflows the u64 type). We end with another `msg!` statement
and then return an `Ok(())` result.

Finally, let's take a look at the struct definitions:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
// Accounts required by the initialize instruction
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    // The account paying to create the counter account
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>, // specify account must be signer on the transaction

    // The counter account being created and initialized in the instruction
    #[account(
        init,         // specifies we are creating this account
        payer = user, // specifies account paying for the creation of the account
        space = 8 + 8 // space allocated to the new account (8 byte discriminator + 8 byte for u64)
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>, // specify account is 'Counter' type
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>, // specify account must be System Program
}

// Account required by the increment instruction
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment<'info> {
    #[account(mut)] // specify account is mutable because we are updating its data
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>, // specify account is 'Counter' type
}

// Define structure of `Counter` account
#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub count: u64, // define count value type as u64
}
```

Make sure you go over the comments!

The `initialize` instruction does only one thing: it creates a new account of
the `Counter` type. To do this, we need to know who's paying, details of the
account we're creating like the space and the address, and which program to use
to create the account.

Let's go line by line:

- `#[derive(Accounts)]` is an attribute that tells Anchor to generate the
  necessary serialization and deserialization code for the accounts.
- `#[account(mut)]` tells Anchor that the account is mutable
- `pub user: Signer<'info>,` the user is of type `Signer<>` that signs and pays
  for the transaction. `'info` is the Rust lifetime.
- `#[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 8)]`
  - `#[account(init)]` tells Anchor that this is an account that will be created
  - `payer = user` tells Anchor that the account is owned by the user
  - `space = 8 + 8` tells Anchor how much space to allocate for the account
- `pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,` the created account should be of type
  `Counter`
- `pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,` adds a constraint that the
  system program must be in the list of accounts for the transaction

**It's normal for this code to feel unfamiliar**. Anchor does things like
separate the account creation and account type declarations. As you write more
programs, you'll get used to it.

The `increment` instruction is far simpler - it expects an account of type
`Counter` passed in. The `Counter` type is just a struct that has a `count`
field of type `u64`, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer.

We're almost ready to build this program!

Each Anchor project has it's own program address when it's first built. Since
you've just copied my code, the program address at the top of your `lib.rs`
won't match yours. To generate a keypair, run `anchor build`, and then run
`anchor keys sync` to set it in your `Anchor.toml` and in the `id` field of your
`lib.rs`.

To recap what the whole flow so far:

- `anchor init` to create a new project
- `anchor build` to compile the template program
- `anchor test --skip-local-validator` to test the template
- delete `target` folder to start from a clean slate
- Update Rust in `lib.rs` with new logic
- `anchor build` to generate a new keypair & compile our new program
- `anchor keys sync` to set the new program address

Next time, you can skip building and testing the template.

### Writing a test for our program

Next up, let's test this program we just wrote. Open up `tests/counter.ts` and
replace it with this:

```ts filename="tests/counter.ts"
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Counter } from "../target/types/counter";
import { Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";

describe("counter", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.Counter as Program<Counter>;

  // Generate a new keypair to use as the address the counter account
  const counterAccount = new Keypair();

  it("Is initialized!", async () => {
    // Invoke the initialize instruction
    const transactionSignature = await program.methods
      .initialize()
      .accounts({
        counter: counterAccount.publicKey,
      })
      .signers([counterAccount]) // include counter keypair as additional signer
      .rpc({ skipPreflight: true });

    // Fetch the counter account data
    const accountData = await program.account.counter.fetch(
      counterAccount.publicKey
    );

    console.log(`Transaction Signature: ${transactionSignature}`);
    console.log(`Count: ${accountData.count}`);
  });

  it("Increment", async () => {
    // Invoke the increment instruction
    const transactionSignature = await program.methods
      .increment()
      .accounts({
        counter: counterAccount.publicKey,
      })
      .rpc();

    // Fetch the counter account data
    const accountData = await program.account.counter.fetch(
      counterAccount.publicKey
    );

    console.log(`Transaction Signature: ${transactionSignature}`);
    console.log(`Count: ${accountData.count}`);
  });
});
```

We've updated the `initialize` test case to match our new logic and added a case
for incrementing. Let's go over how we did this line by line.

```ts
const counterAccount = new Keypair();
```

First, we generate a new keypair to use as the address the counter account. This
is where the data of the counter will be stored.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await program.methods
  .initialize()
  .accounts({
    counter: counterAccount.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([counterAccount]) // include counter keypair as additional signer
  .rpc({ skipPreflight: true });
```

Next, we pass in this address in the context of the initialize instruction as
`counter`. Since this account will be changed, we also need to include it as a
signer. To close out the test case we fetch the account data and print out the
value of the counter.

The `increment` test case calls the increment instruction and fetches the
account data, but since we've already initialized it, we just pass in the
address of the counter account from global state.

Now that we're printing out messages in our logs, we'll set up a log viewer.
Open another terminal and run `solana logs`. This will stream Solana transaction
logs. You can also view transactions in the
[Solana explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom&customUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8899)
by configuring it to use the local cluster.

Let's run this! `anchor test --skip-local-validator` should give you:

```shell
Count: 1
    ✔ Increment (3973ms)

  2 passing (8s)

Done in 26.34s.
```

### Finalize your Anchor program with a PDA

The program we have is pretty good and it does what we want, but it's using an
inefficient method of storing data and is not completely secure.

Right now, we're manually creating an account for storing counter data. This
requires keeping track of the account, and if the keypair is leaked anyone can
change its value. We are also statically allocating the account size, which is
not ideal.

The right way to store data is with a Program Derived Address. A PDA is an
account that's controlled by a program with an address that you can "derive"
from a combination of known items: a seed (a string of our choice) and the
program ID. The data stored in a PDA is more secure because only the program can
change it.

Now, instead of having to keep track of and manage a keypair that stores the
data, we can just use a function that derives a PDA for us (this code is only
for reference):

```ts
// new method
const [counterPDA] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("counter")], // This is the seed -- just the string "counter"
  program.programId // If we're interacting with the program, we know its ID
);

// vs old method
const counterAccount = new Keypair(); // You have to keep track of this value
// can't be easily shared with others
// security concern - if the keypair is leaked, anyone can change the value
```

The final bit of a PDA is a `bump` number. This is an extra item that is used to
make sure the generated address does not have a private key. So you find a PDA
using:

- program id
- seed (your string)
- bump (a number stored in the account)

Here's what the updated code in your `lib.rs` for this is:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("C87Mkt2suddDsb6Y15hJyGQzu9itMhU7RGxTQw17mTm");

#[program]
pub mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.bump = ctx.bumps.counter; // store bump seed in `Counter` account
        msg!("Counter account created! Current count: {}", counter.count);
        msg!("Counter bump: {}", counter.bump);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        msg!("Previous counter: {}", counter.count);
        counter.count = counter.count.checked_add(1).unwrap();
        msg!("Counter incremented! Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,

    // Create and initialize `Counter` account using a PDA as the address
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"counter"], // optional seeds for pda
        bump,                 // bump seed for pda
        payer = user,
        space = 8 + Counter::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment<'info> {
    // The address of the `Counter` account must be a PDA derived with the specified `seeds`
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"counter"], // optional seeds for pda
        bump = counter.bump,  // bump seed for pda stored in `Counter` account
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Counter {
    pub count: u64, // 8 bytes
    pub bump: u8,   // 1 byte
}
```

Make sure you run `anchor keys sync` here if you've copy/pasted everything.
You'll also need to make sure you have `seeds` enabled as an Anchor feature.
Open your `Anchor.toml` file add set `seeds = true` in the `[features]` section:

```toml
[toolchain]

[features]
seeds = true
skip-lint = false
```

You know most of this code. Let's dive into the changes we made to use a PDA:

In the `initialize` function, we store the `bump` seed in the `Counter` account
with `counter.bump = ctx.bumps.counter;`. This allows us to retrieve the bump
seed later when we need to derive the PDA again. We're also allocating space
based on the size of the `Counter` struct.

In the `Initialize` struct, we've updated the `#[account()]` attribute for the
`counter` field:

- `seeds = [b"counter"]` specifies the seed used to derive the PDA. In this
  case, it's just the string "counter" converted to a byte slice.
- `bump` tells Anchor to use the canonical bump number for the PDA.

The `Increment` struct has also been updated with the same PDA seed and bump.
Finally, the `Counter` struct now includes a `bump` field to store the bump
seed.

This approach provides better security and eliminates the need to manage a
separate keypair for the counter account. The bump seed is stored in the Counter
account itself, making it easy to retrieve when needed.

Let's test this! Here is what the new test in `tests/counter.ts` will look like:

```ts filename="tests/counter.ts"
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Counter } from "../target/types/counter";
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

describe("counter", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.Counter as Program<Counter>;

  const [counterPDA] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [Buffer.from("counter")],
    program.programId
  );

  it("Is initialized!", async () => {
    try {
      const txSig = await program.methods
        .initialize()
        .accounts({
          counter: counterPDA,
        })
        .rpc();

      const accountData = await program.account.counter.fetch(counterPDA);
      console.log(`Transaction Signature: ${txSig}`);
      console.log(`Count: ${accountData.count}`);
    } catch (error) {
      // If PDA Account already created, then we expect an error
      console.log(error);
    }
  });

  it("Increment", async () => {
    const transactionSignature = await program.methods
      .increment()
      .accounts({
        counter: counterPDA,
      })
      .rpc();

    const accountData = await program.account.counter.fetch(counterPDA);

    console.log(`Transaction Signature: ${transactionSignature}`);
    console.log(`Count: ${accountData.count}`);
  });
});
```

As you can see, we're not generating a keypair here. Everything we need to
initialize this program and interact with it is easily definable and shareable.

Now it's time to deploy this. Solana programs don't store state - everything is
stored in accounts. This makes it easy to upgrade programs without having to
worry about losing data. When you deploy a program, space is only allocated to
be double the first program's size you deploy. So if your original program is
100 bytes, the new program can be up to 200 bytes. If your program is bigger,
you'll have to extend it.

Our new program is more than 2x the size of the original so if we run
`anchor test --skip-local-validator` we'll get this error:

```shell
Error: Deploying program failed: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction [3 log messages]
```

We have three options here:

- Extend the size of the old program account
- Deploy a new program
- Reset the local validator

Let's go with the first option since we have millions in SOL. First, let's get
the size of the old program account:

```shell
solana program show C87Mkt2suddDsb6Y15hJyGQzu9itMhU7RGxTQw17mTm
```

You'll see the output look something like this:

```shell
Program Id: C87Mkt2suddDsb6Y15hJyGQzu9itMhU7RGxTQw17mTm
Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111
ProgramData Address: 22D5oHo5q8LtdvYePrSBwy6D58z2K9KKwdn6W1UiEQEz
Authority: FmpP9UGJUBoYUDFpBYALDGudAZtTTmK46tBpC6TkcXry
Last Deployed In Slot: 283249128
Data Length: 204080 (0x31d30) bytes
Balance: 1.42160088 SOL
```

To find out the size of the new program, run this:

```shell
du -h target/deploy/counter.so
```

This will print the disk usage of the compiled program. If you wanna find out
how much SOL this will cost:

```shell
solana rent 200000
```

Let's extend, you need the program ID and the extension size in bytes:

```shell
solana program extend C87Mkt2suddDsb6Y15hJyGQzu9itMhU7RGxTQw17mTm 200000
```

Now we can deploy and test the new program:

```shell
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

The first command will update the program address in your `lib.rs` file. The
second command will build, deploy, and test your program on your local test
validator.

### Deploy to devnet

From here on out, we're DONE with local development. We will be using Solana's
devnet for the rest of this guide. Solana's devnet is a public development
blockchain with real data and fake tokens on it. Think of it like your "staging
environment" before deploying your code to production.

We'll need some Solana devnet tokens to pay for transactions. You can configure
your CLI wallet to devnet and get some tokens with these commands:

```
solana config set --url devnet
solana airdrop 2
```

If this doesn't work, you can print out your wallet address with
`solana address` and use the [Solana faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/) to get
some tokens.

Now we're ready to deploy our program to the devnet. Here's a summary of what
we'll be doing:

- Update our `Anchor.toml` file to use the devnet
- Deploy our program to the devnet
- Rerun the test to initialize our program and increment the counter

Update your `Anchor.toml` file to use the devnet network and add the address for
your devnet program:

```toml
[toolchain]

[features]
seeds = true
skip-lint = false

[programs.localnet]
counter = "Bims5KmWhFne1m1UT4bfSknBEoECeYfztoKrsR2jTnrA"

[programs.devnet]
counter = "Bims5KmWhFne1m1UT4bfSknBEoECeYfztoKrsR2jTnrA"

[registry]
url = "https://api.apr.dev"

[provider]
cluster = "devnet"
wallet = "/home/endgame/.config/solana/id.json"

[scripts]
test = "yarn run ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/**/*.ts"
```

What's changed? I've added a new `[programs.devnet]` section and under the
`[provider]` section, changed the `cluster` to `devnet`.

We're ready to deploy! Run `anchor test` and you should see this:

```shell
Deploying cluster: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Upgrade authority: /home/endgame/.config/solana/id.json
Deploying program "counter"...
Program path: /full-stack-solana-dev/counter/target/deploy/counter.so...
Program Id: F7nbbscQpQucypsjzJccBDLBSVAVKBHumNLpxqHXym4U

Deploy success

Found a 'test' script in the Anchor.toml. Running it as a test suite!

Running test suite: "/full-stack-solana-dev/counter/Anchor.toml"
```

Copy the address and check it out on the
[Solana explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet).

You're off localhost! Anyone on the internet can now interact with your program.
Let's give them a front-end to do that.

#### Program deploy failed?

Program code is temporarily stored in
[buffer accounts](/docs/programs/deploying.md#state-accounts) while programs are
being deployed. You can view and close these accounts with:

```shell
solana program show --buffers
solana program close --buffers
```

#### Running out of gas?

If you've completely run out of gas, you can close programs you've previously
deployed. This is **not reversible**. These programs will be deleted and can't
be re-deployed. As a last resort:

```shell
solana program close --programid <program id>
```

Or if you're feeling really daring:

```shell
solana program close --all
```

## Build a React client for your app

Now that your Solana program is live on the public devnet blockchain, you have
several options for interacting with it. Any client you can think of will work -
Node.js script, React app, mobile app, even a serverless function. In this
guide, we will be building a React app.

### Set up your React project

There's a bunch of Solana templates available for front-ends that give you
everything you need. **We are not going to use a Solana template**. They often
come with a lot of stuff added in and can be overwhelming for a beginner.

Instead, I'm going to walk you through doing it yourself. This will help you
understand what the templates are doing and show you how simple integrating
Solana wallets can be.

We'll be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) because it is more simple than
Next.js and keeps things light. What you'll learn here will apply to ALL React
frameworks - Next, Remix, etc.

Start by opening a new terminal window and creating a new vite project inside
your workspace (make sure you're outside the `counter` folder):

```shell
yarn create vite
```

Name it whatever you want (I've named mine `front-end`). Select React as your
framework and Typescript as the variant. Don't worry, we're not going to be
doing any fancy Typescript stuff!

If you're on Windows and using WSL, you'll need to update your `vite.config.ts`
file so hot reloading works. Open it up and change it to this:

```javascript
// WSL USERS ON WINDOWS ONLY (NOT NECESSARY FOR LINUX/MACOS)
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    watch: {
      usePolling: true,
    },
  },
});
```

Next, navigate into the `front-end` folder and run `yarn` to install all the
dependencies:

```shell
cd front-end
yarn
```

Your front-end is ready! Run the command `yarn dev` and open up your React app
at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Create a connect wallet button

There is no need to build a "connect wallet button" from scratch. The Solana
ecosystem has some really nice wallet adapter libraries that make adding wallets
plug-n-play. You can even customize the styling!

Throw this command into your terminal to install all the `wallet-adapter` stuff
we need:

```shell
yarn add react @solana/web3.js@1 \
  @solana/wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-adapter-react \
  @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
```

Ready to see some magic happen? Open up your `front-end/src/App.tsx` file and
replace the code in there with this:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { useMemo } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionProvider,
  WalletProvider,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-base";
import {
  WalletModalProvider,
  WalletMultiButton,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";
import "./App.css";

// Default styles that can be overridden by your app
import "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css";

function App() {
  // The network can be set to 'devnet', 'testnet', or 'mainnet-beta'.
  const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
  // You can also provide a custom RPC endpoint.
  const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);

  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      // if desired, manually define specific/custom wallets here (normally not required)
      // otherwise, the wallet-adapter will auto detect the wallets a user's browser has available
    ],
    [network]
  );

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
        <WalletModalProvider>
          <WalletMultiButton />
          <h1>Hello Solana</h1>
        </WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code snippet and configuration is taken directly from the
[wallet-adapter docs](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/master/APP.md).
All we're doing here is bringing in the `wallet-adapter` imports, setting up a
Solana network connection, and wrapping our app with the necessary context
providers.

Head back to `http://localhost:5173/` and you should see this:

![localhost vite app with select wallet button](/assets/guides/full-stack-solana-dev/fs-hello-solana.png)

We're ready to rumble!

P.S. you can change the app title in `index.html`.

### Reading from the blockchain

Are you ready to read data directly from the blockchain within your frontend?
This is easier than you think!

First we need to build the layer that connects our deployed program with our
front-end React app. We'll define what our program is and how to interact with
it using the IDL generated from Anchor when we last ran `anchor build`.

Create a new folder named `anchor` in `front-end/src` and copy over
`target/types/counter.ts` (from the Anchor program) to a new file called
`idl.ts`. We'll use the IDL to create Typescript objects that let us interact
with our program.

We'll need the Anchor SDK in our front-end to create the interfaces for the
program. Install it with:

```shell
yarn add @coral-xyz/anchor@0.29
```

Now for the "connection layer" code. Create a `setup.ts` file in the
`front-end/src/anchor` folder and add this to it:

```ts filename="setup.ts"
import { IdlAccounts, Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { IDL, Counter } from "./idl";
import { clusterApiUrl, Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const programId = new PublicKey("B2Sj5CsvGJvYEVUgF1ZBnWsBzWuHRQLrgMSJDjBU5hWA");
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"), "confirmed");

// Initialize the program interface with the IDL, program ID, and connection.
// This setup allows us to interact with the on-chain program using the defined interface.
export const program = new Program<Counter>(IDL, programId, {
  connection,
});

export const [counterPDA] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("counter")],
  program.programId
);

// This is just a TypeScript type for the Counter data structure based on the IDL
// We need this so TypeScript doesn't yell at us
export type CounterData = IdlAccounts<Counter>["counter"];
```

What we're doing here is using the interface to lay the groundwork for
interacting with our program. We're generating the PDA for the counter account -
we need this because anytime we send a Solana transaction, we have to specify
all the accounts that will be changed by that transaction.

If we're minting a token, or changing the value of the counter, those accounts
will change, and we need to include their addresses in the transaction. These
are in their own file in`setup.ts` so we can access them in anywhere in our app.

Make sure you remember to replace the `programId` value with the address of YOUR
program. Now that we have everything set up, we ready to read data from the
blockchain!

Create a new directory named `components` in `front-end/src` and add a
`counter-state.tsx` file in it with this code:

```tsx filename="counter-state.tsx"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useConnection } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { program, counterPDA, CounterData } from "../anchor/setup";

export default function CounterState() {
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const [counterData, setCounterData] = useState<CounterData | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCounterData = async () => {
      try {
        // Fetch initial account data
        const data = await program.account.counter.fetch(counterPDA);
        setCounterData(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching counter data:", error);
      }
    };

    fetchCounterData();

    // Subscribe to account change
    const subscriptionId = connection.onAccountChange(
      // The address of the account we want to watch
      counterPDA,
      // Callback for when the account changes
      (accountInfo) => {
        try {
          const decodedData = program.coder.accounts.decode(
            "counter",
            accountInfo.data
          );
          setCounterData(decodedData);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error decoding account data:", error);
        }
      }
    );

    return () => {
      // Unsubscribe from account change
      connection.removeAccountChangeListener(subscriptionId);
    };

    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [program, counterPDA, connection]);

  // Render the value of the counter
  return <p className="text-lg">Count: {counterData?.count?.toString()}</p>;
}
```

Above, we use `program.account.counter.fetch(counterPDA)` to fetch the onchain
value of counter when the React app loads. And also subscribe to any changes of
that onchain data with `connection.onAccountChange`, which takes in a callback
as the second value. The callback decodes the data we get back and sets it.

The final step is to add the `CounterState` component to our `App.tsx` file. Add
this to the bottom of the file:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
// ... previous imports
// Import the component we just created
import CounterState from "./components/counter-state";

function App() {
  const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
  const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);

  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      // if desired, manually define specific/custom wallets here (normally not required)
      // otherwise, the wallet-adapter will auto detect the wallets a user's browser has available
    ],
    [network]
  );

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
        <WalletModalProvider>
          <WalletMultiButton />
          <h1>Hello Solana</h1>
          // ADD THIS LINE
          <CounterState />
        </WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now if you open up `http://localhost:5173/` and you should see something like:

```shell
Count: 2
```

WOAH. WE JUST READ DATA FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN. Let's keep the momentum rolling by
writing data to the blockchain!

### Writing to the blockchain

Now to add increment functionality. We're going to put it all in a button
component. Create a new file `components/increment-button.tsx` and add this
code:

```tsx filename="increment-button.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import { useConnection, useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { program } from "../anchor/setup";

export default function IncrementButton() {
  const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet();
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const onClick = async () => {
    if (!publicKey) return;

    setIsLoading(true);

    try {
      // Create a transaction to invoke the increment function
      const transaction = await program.methods
        .increment() // This takes no arguments so we don't need to pass anything
        .transaction();

      const transactionSignature = await sendTransaction(
        transaction,
        connection
      );

      console.log(
        `View on explorer: https://solana.fm/tx/${transactionSignature}?cluster=devnet-alpha`
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button className="w-24" onClick={onClick} disabled={!publicKey}>
      {isLoading ? "Loading" : "Increment"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

You know most of this code. The only new thing happening here is the transaction
we're sending. We're using the `program.methods.increment()` method to create a
transaction that increments the counter and mints our token. The accounts passed
in are the user's wallet and the associated token account for the user's wallet.

Add our new `IncrementButton` component into the `App.tsx` to see the button:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
// ... previous imports
// Import the component we just created
import IncrementButton from "./components/increment-button";

function App() {
  const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
  const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);

  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      // if desired, manually define specific/custom wallets here (normally not required)
      // otherwise, the wallet-adapter will auto detect the wallets a user's browser has available
    ],
    [network]
  );

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
        <WalletModalProvider>
          <WalletMultiButton />
          <h1>Hello Solana</h1>
          <CounterState />
          <IncrementButton />
        </WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Open up `http://localhost:5173/` and you should now see a button. Make sure you
are connected to `devnet` on your browser wallet and click that button. You
should see a popup or notification that will ask you to sign a transaction.
After you confirm that transaction, you should see the counter increment and the
associated token account minted.

You did it! You are now a full-stack Solana developer.
