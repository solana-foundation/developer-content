For this "hello world" quickstart guide, we will use
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/hello_world_pg),
a browser-based IDE to develop and deploy our Solana program. To use it, you do
**NOT** have to install any software on your computer. Simply open Solana
Playground in your browser of choice, and you are ready to write and deploy
Solana programs.

## What you will learn

- how to get started with Solana Playground
- how to create a Solana wallet on Playground
- how to program a basic Solana program in Rust
- how to build and deploy a Solana Rust program
- how to interact with your onchain program using JavaScript

## Using Solana Playground

[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/hello_world_pg)
is browser-based application that will let you write, build, and deploy onchain
Solana programs. All from your browser. No installation needed.

It is a great developer resource for getting started with Solana development,
especially on Windows.

### Import our example project

In a new tab in your browser, open our example "_Hello World_"
[project on Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/hello_world_pg)

Next, import the project into your local workspace by clicking the "**Import**"
icon and naming your project `hello_world`.

![Import Hello World project](/assets/guides/hello-world-pg/pg-import.png)

> If you do **not** import the program into **your** Solana Playground, then you
> will **not** be able to make changes to the code. But you **will** still be
> able to build and deploy the code to a Solana cluster.

### Create a Playground wallet

Normally with
[local development](/content/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development.md), you
will need to create a file system wallet for use with the Solana CLI. But with
the Solana Playground, you only need to click a few buttons to create a
browser-based wallet.

> Your _Playground Wallet_ will be saved in your browser's local storage.
> Clearing your browser cache will remove your saved wallet. When creating a new
> wallet, you will have the option to save a local copy of your wallet's keypair
> file.

Click on the red status indicator button at the bottom left of the screen,
(optionally) save your wallet's keypair file to your computer for backup, then
click "**Continue**".

![Connect your playground wallet](/assets/guides/hello-world-pg/pg-connect-wallet.png)

After your Playground Wallet is created, you will notice the bottom of the
window now states your wallet's address, your SOL balance, and the Solana
cluster you are connected to (Devnet is usually the default/recommended, but a
"localhost"
[test validator](/content/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development.md) is also
acceptable).

## Create a Solana program

The code for your Rust based Solana program will live in your `src/lib.rs` file.
Inside `src/lib.rs` you will be able to import your Rust crates and define your
logic. Open your `src/lib.rs` file within Solana Playground.

### Import the `solana_program` crate

At the top of `lib.rs`, we import the `solana-program` crate and bring our
needed items into the local namespace:

```rust
use solana_program::{
    account_info::AccountInfo,
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    msg,
};
```

### Write your program logic

Every Solana program must define an `entrypoint` that tells the Solana runtime
where to start executing your onchain code. Your program's
[entrypoint](/docs/programs/lang-rust.md#program-entrypoint) should provide a
public function named `process_instruction`:

```rust
// declare and export the program's entrypoint
entrypoint!(process_instruction);

// program entrypoint's implementation
pub fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8]
) -> ProgramResult {
    // log a message to the blockchain
    msg!("Hello, world!");

    // gracefully exit the program
    Ok(())
}
```

Every onchain program should return the `Ok`
[result enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) with a value of `()`. This
tells the Solana runtime that your program executed successfully without errors.

Our program above will simply
[log a message](/docs/programs/debugging.md#logging) of "_Hello, world!_" to the
blockchain cluster, then gracefully exit with `Ok(())`.

### Build your program

On the left sidebar above the `lib.rs` file click the `Build` button.  

If you look at the Playground's terminal, you should see your Solana program
begin to compile. Once complete, you will see a success message.

![Build and Deploy](/assets/guides/hello-world-pg/pg-build-and-deploy.png)

### Deploy your program

You can click the "Deploy" button to deploy your first program to the Solana
blockchain. Specifically to your selected cluster (e.g. Devnet, Testnet, etc).

After each deployment, you will see your Playground Wallet balance change. By
default, Solana Playground will automatically request SOL airdrops on your
behalf to ensure your wallet has enough SOL to cover the cost of deployment.

If you need more devnet SOL in order to deploy your program, you can airdrop
more by typing the airdrop command in the playground terminal:

```shell
solana airdrop 2
```

> If you get a rate limit error when requesting devnet SOL you can also you can
> just type `run` in the terminal and you will get a link to a
> [web faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/). You can also find your wallet
> address at the bottom of the playground window.

You should see a `Deployment successful` message similar to this:

![Deploy Success](/assets/guides/hello-world-pg/pg-deploy-success.png)

> Instead of using the buttons in playground you can also type `build` and
> `deploy` in the terminal as well. For a list of all commands you can use in
> the terminal you can type `help`.

#### Congratulations!

You have successfully setup, built, and deployed a Solana program using the Rust
language directly in your browser. Next, we will demonstrate how to interact
with your onchain program to actually see our 'Hello World'.

## Interact with your onchain program

Once you have successfully deployed a Solana program to the blockchain, you will
want to be able to interact with that program.

Like most developers creating dApps and websites, we will interact with our on
chain program using JavaScript. Specifically, will use the open source
[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js) `@solana/web3.js`
to aid in our client application.

> This web3.js package is an abstraction layer on top of the
> [JSON RPC API](/docs/rpc.md) that reduced the need for rewriting common
> boilerplate, helping to simplify your client side application code.

### The JavaScript client

Now let's take a look at how to actually call our program. The example comes
with a JavaScript client that will call our hello world program. You can find 
the `client.ts` file on the left-hand side of the playground.

### Call the program

To execute your onchain program, you must send a
[transaction](/docs/core/transactions.md) to the network. Each transaction
submitted to the Solana blockchain contains a list of
[instructions](/docs/core/transactions.md#instruction).

Here we create a new transaction and add a single `instruction` to it:

```js
// create an empty transaction
const transaction = new web3.Transaction();

// add a hello world program instruction to the transaction
transaction.add(
  new web3.TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [],
    programId: new web3.PublicKey(pg.PROGRAM_ID),
  }),
);
```

Each `instruction` must include all the keys involved in the operation and the
program ID we want to execute. In this example `keys` is empty because our
program only logs `hello world` and doesn't need any accounts.

With our transaction created, we can submit it to the cluster:

```js
// send the transaction to the Solana cluster
console.log("Sending transaction...");
const txHash = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  pg.connection,
  transaction,
  [pg.wallet.keypair],
);
console.log("Transaction sent with hash:", txHash);
```

> The first signer in the signers array is the transaction fee payer by default.
> We are signing with our keypair `pg.wallet.keypair`.

### Run the application

Now that you know how the client works, you can run the code via the `run`
command. Just type it in the playground terminal and press enter.

```shell
run
```

Once your application completes, you will see output similar to this:

```shell
$ run
Running client...
  client.ts:
    ProgramID:  C7JcX81YDaDJ9Bf8ebifLgBSqfKJxETek6qyTuPGJE1f
    Transaction sent with hash: m7f7dszzdNshMZo5u2gRKjbyURk1tQHj7Hmeh3AbH7wUdnmDXmCJhA8cXJjYwVN7foJaLQiPYhEFTn6F5mWSeCb
    Congratulations! Look at your transaction in the Solana Explorer:
  https://explorer.solana.com/tx/m7f7dszzdNshMZo5u2gRKjbyURk1tQHj7Hmeh3AbH7wUdnmDXmCJhA8cXJjYwVN7foJaLQiPYhEFTn6F5mWSeCb?cluster=devnet
```

You can now click on the link provided to view your transaction in the Solana
Explorer. If you scroll to the bottom you should see `Hello, world!` in the
**Log Messages** section of the program output. 🎉

#### Congratulations!!!

You have now written a Solana program, deployed it to devnet and called the
program. You are now a Solana developer!

PS: Try to update your program's message then re-build, re-deploy, and
re-execute your program.

### Look at the deployed program

Now that we called our program let's have a look at the account where the
program is actually saved.

When executing a program using [web3.js](/docs/clients/javascript-reference.md)
or from [another Solana program](/docs/core/cpi.md), you will need to provide
the `program id` (aka public address of your program).

Inside Solana Playground's **Build & Deploy** sidebar, you can find your
`program id` under the **Program Credentials** dropdown.

![Find Program Id](/assets/guides/hello-world-pg/pg-find-program-id.png)

You can copy this program id and look at your program in the
[solana explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) by pasting
the address into the search bar.

### Playground globals

In playground, there are many utilities that are globally available for us to
use without installing or setting up anything. Most important ones for our
`hello world` program are `web3` for `@solana/web3.js` and `pg` for Solana
Playground utilities.

> You can go over all of the available globals by pressing `Ctrl+Space` (or
> `Cmd+Space` on macOS) inside the editor.
