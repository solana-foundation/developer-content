In this guide, you will create a new token on Solana. We'll be using the Solana
CLI, the new
[Token Extensions program](https://solana.com/news/token-extensions-developer-guide)
and the
[Token Metadata extension](https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/metadata-pointer),
which allows us to simplify the process a little.

<Callout type="note">
The steps in this guide are for Token Extensions Program, i.e. program ID
`TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb`. This Token Extensions program simplified making tokens because metadata - like the token name, symbol and the URI for the file that describes images - can be [stored directly on the token mint](https://explorer.solana.com/address/mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ?cluster=devnet).

The older Token Program, i.e. program ID
`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` required storing metadata in an
additional account outside our mint. Tokens using the metadata extension have
wide support in Solana Wallets and Explorers, but if you can also [use the older
token program and Metaplex](https://developers.metaplex.com/ token-metadata)
instead. </Callout>

## Installing Solana Tools

First we need to download Solana tools to our system. Follow this guide to
[install the Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install).

## Create folder

Open a new terminal and create a new folder:

```bash
mkdir new-token
cd new-token
```

## Create a keypair for the mint authority

In a moment, we will make a **token mint account** - i.e., a factory that makes
our specific token. But before we do that, we'll need to create an account to
use as our **mint authority** - which you can think of as the 'boss' that will
run that factory. We'll also use this account as the **freeze authority** and
**metadata update authority**. This account will need to sign transactions that
mint new tokens, freeze the mint, or update the metadata for our token.

Let's make `1` keypair where the public key starts with `bos`, short for 'boss'.
You can add more letters, but it will take longer to generate the key. Four is
still ok, but five will take a long time.

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with bos:1
```

This will save the keypair into a JSON file, named after the public key:

```bash
bosy1VC2BH2gh5fdXA3oKn53EuATLwapLWC4VR2sGHJ.json
```

<Callout type="note">
Replace the `bos` public key above with your mint authority public key in the following steps!
</Callout>

Keep the contents of the mint authority keypair file safe. Whoever owns the key
will be able to mint tokens, update metadata, and potentially freeze token
accounts!

Configure the Solana CLI to use to use the keypair we just created, for example:

```bash
solana config set --keypair bosy1VC2BH2gh5fdXA3oKn53EuATLwapLWC4VR2sGHJ.json
```

We will also set the Solana CLI to use devnet:

```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

From now on, all transactions you run from the CLI will be signed using the
`bos` keypair and be on devnet.

You can see the current configuration by running:

```bash
solana config get
```

![`solana config get` showing devnet and our mint authority account](/assets/guides/make-a-token/solana-config-get.png)

## Get some Devnet SOL for the mint authority

![Solana Faucet](/assets/guides/make-a-token/solana-faucet.png)

For Solana devnet we will just be able to get some free SOL,
[the DevNet faucet](https://faucet.solana.com) If you get rate limited, follow
this
[guide to get devnet SOL](/content/guides/getstarted/solana-token-airdrop-and-faucets.md).
Remember to fund your mint authority account - i.e. the keypair that starts with
`bos` in your `new-token` folder. You can also just run:

```bash
solana address
```

For mainnet you will need to fund the account with actual SOL. You can buy SOL
with regular currency in places like centralized exchanges, crypto on-ramps, or
swap other tokens for SOL on decentralized exchanges.

## Make a Mint Address (`mnt`)

Let's create one more address that we will use for our **Mint Account** - the
factory that makes our specific token. We'll make it start with `mnt` to help us
remember it's the token **mint account**.

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with mnt:1
```

It will save a new keypair named after the public key:
`mntDh6s9hd2wbbS6ZWaYTCC9GXxhXGvbWpUgLt5qYgv.json`

<Callout type="note">
Replace the `mnt` address with your token mint account's address in the following steps!
</Callout>

## Creating the token mint account

First, let's decide on a decimal place. Since computers use binary, they can't
handle decimal numbers very well. That's why financial programs - both in
traditional finance and blockchains - usually transfer value in a whole amount
of **minor units**, e.g., cents (for USD) or pence (for GBP). Likewise, you can
set a decimal point for the token. For example
[USDC](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v)
has 6 decimals, which means that each USDC can be split into one-millionth of a
USDC. To transfer 1 USDC, you transfer 1 million USDC cents.

You can configure different decimals for your token by adding the `--decimals`
flag to the command. If you do not set it, the default is 9.

Now, we will create the token mint, specifying to use the Token Extensions
Program (`TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb`), with the metadata
extension enabled.

We will use our `mnt...` address as the
[token mint account](/docs/core/tokens.md#mint-account) for our new token:

```bash
spl-token create-token --program-id TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb --enable-metadata mntsBJFZE48XnQteT1vekH35UXDfamtdpFv6Xh8A7Gy.json
```

<Callout type="note">
This is also time time to add additional
[token extensions](/content/guides/token-extensions/getting-started.md) to your
token to have extra functionality, for example
[transfer fees](/content/guides/token-extensions/transfer-fee.md).
You cannot add more extensions to your token mint after you create
the token mint account.
</Callout>

## Create and upload image and offchain metadata

Next, we will create the offchain metadata for our token. This data is displayed
on sites like [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com) when people look at
our token mint address.

Metadata and media referenced inside (like the `image` ) must be saved somewhere
publicly accessible online.

For production tokens, a decentralized storage service like one of the following
is considered more appropriate:

- [Akord](https://akord.com/) - uploads to Arweave; free without sign up for
  100Mb; uploads can take a while.
- [NFT Storage](https://nft.storage/) - popular
- [Irys](https://irys.xyz/) - formerly known as Bundlr, uploads to Arweave.

- [Metaboss](https://metaboss.rs/) - by Metaplex

- [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) - uploads to IPFS; free with sign up for
  1Gb;

- [ShadowDrive](https://www.shdwdrive.com/) - a Solana native storage solution.

- [web3.storage](https://web3.storage) - requires signing up for a free plan;
  first 5Gb are free; easy to use.

<Callout type="note">

If you are a provider of decentralized storage solutions and want to be listed
here, please open a PR using the 'edit page' button.

</Callout>

For a test token, a centralized storage solution like AWS S3, GCP, or GitHub
(using the 'raw' URL format `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` ) is fine.

#### Upload the image

First, upload your image file to your desired online storage solution and get
the link. **Ensure that the link directly opens your image file!**

```text
https://github.com/mikemaccana/token-command-line/blob/main/lights.png
```

#### Create and Upload the offchain metadata file

Create a `metadata.json` file, add a name, symbol and description plus the image
you just uploaded:

```json filename="metadata.json"
{
  "name": "Example Token",
  "symbol": "EXMPL",
  "description": "Example token for Solana Foundation Bootcamp.",
  "image": "https://github.com/mikemaccana/token-command-line/blob/main/lights.png"
}
```

Then upload the `metadata.json` to the storage provider of your choice. You will
end up with a link similar to this:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikemaccana/token-command-line/main/metadata.json
```

**Ensure that the link directly opens your metadata file!**

Now, we can add this metadata to our token.

## Add the metadata to the token

<Callout type="note">

As mentioned earlier, this step only works for tokens using the Token Extensions
program ( `TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb`), and not the older
Token Program (`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`).

</Callout>

Now we will initialize the metadata for our token with the metadata we just
created and uploaded.

```bash
spl-token initialize-metadata mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ 'Example token' 'EXMPL' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikemaccana/token-command-line/main/metadata.json
```

Congratulations, you created a token with metadata! Look at your token in one of
the Solana block explorers:

- [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ?cluster=devnet)
- [SolanaFM](https://solana.fm/?cluster=devnet-solana)
- [SolScan](https://solscan.io/token/mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ)

Make sure your explorer is set to devnet (if you are working on devnet) and
replace the address to your mint address starting with `mnt`.

![Token with metadata](/assets/guides/make-a-token/token-with-metadata.png)

## Mint tokens

Now that the token is completely set up we can mint some tokens. Let's mint 100.

First we need to create a token account to hold the tokens for our token mint:

```bash
spl-token create-account mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ
```

This will create a new token account for the account that is currently set in
the Solana config. You can also specify a different account by adding the
address at the end of the command.

And now we can finally mint some tokens into that token account:

```bash
spl-token mint mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ 100
```

Open Solana Explorer and look at your new token balance!

![Our minted tokens in our account](/assets/guides/make-a-token/minted-tokens-in-new-account.png)

Now you can also send the token to another owner of the tokens, for example:

```bash
spl-token transfer mntTymSqMU4e1NEDdxJ9XoPN4MitCgQ7xxGW6AuRAWQ 10 (recipient wallet address) --fund-recipient
```

The `--fund-recipient` flag allows you to pay to create the token account (i.e.
the account rent) for the recipient.

You have now created a token mint, minted tokens, and transferred them!

Congratulations!
