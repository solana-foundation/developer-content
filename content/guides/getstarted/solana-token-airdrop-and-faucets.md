# How to get Solana devnet SOL (including airdrops and faucets)

This is a collection of the different ways for developers to acquire SOL on
Solana's testing networks, the Solana devnet and testnet.

## 1. Solana Airdrop

_Available on Devnet and Testnet_

This is the base way of acquiring SOL, but it can be subject to rate limits when
there is a high number of airdrops.

Here are three different ways of requesting airdrops with it:

### Using the Solana CLI:

```shell
solana airdrop 2
```

### Using web3.js:

```js
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
connection.requestAirdrop();
```

See more:
[`requestAirdrop()`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#requestAirdrop)
documentation inside web3.js.

## 2. Web Faucet

_Available for Devnet_

1. [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) - A public web faucet hosted
   by the Solana Foundation
2. [SolFaucet.com](https://solfaucet.com/) - Web UI for airdrops from the public
   RPC endpoints
3. [QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/solana/devnet) - A web faucet
   operated by QuickNode

_Available for Testnet_

1. [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) - A public web faucet hosted
   by the Solana Foundation
2. [SolFaucet.com](https://solfaucet.com/) - Web UI for airdrops from the public
   RPC endpoints
3. [QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/solana/testnet) - A web faucet
   operated by QuickNode
4. [TestnetFaucet.org](https://testnetfaucet.org) - A web faucet with a rate
   limit separate than the public RPC endpoints, operated by
   [@Ferric](https://twitter.com/ferric)

## 3. RPC Provider Faucets

_Available for Devnet_

RPC Providers can opt in to distributing devnet SOL via their devnet Validators.

> If you are an RPC Provider and want to distribute SOL please
> [get in touch here](https://c852ena8x5c.typeform.com/to/cUj1iRhS).

Currently supported:

1. [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/)
2. [QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/solana/devnet)
3. [Triton](https://triton.one/)

### Using the Solana CLI

Specify your [Cluster](https://docs.solana.com/clusters) to be your RPC
provider's URL:

```shell
solana config set --url <your RPC url>
```

Then you can request an airdrop like you would in the first option in this
guide:

```shell
solana airdrop 2
```

### Using Web3.js

```js
const connection = new Connection("your RPC url");
connection.requestAirdrop();
```

## 4. Proof of work Faucet

_Available for Devnet_

This is a proof of work Faucet where devnet SOL can be distributed to you thanks
to your computing power.

**Install the Devnet POW Crate:**

```shell
cargo install devnet-pow
```

**Start mining devnet SOL**

```shell
devnet-pow mine
```

_⚠️ The [POW Faucet](https://github.com/jarry-xiao/proof-of-work-faucet) is
maintained by Ellipsis Labs_

## 5. Discord Faucets

Various Discord communities have setup devnet SOL Faucets as BOTs.

| Community      | Usage                                                       | Link                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| The 76 Devs    | Run `!gibsol` in the BOT commands channel.                  | [Join Server](https://discord.gg/RrChGyDeRv) |
| The LamportDAO | Run `/drop <address> <amount>` in the BOT commands channel. | [Join Server](https://discord.gg/JBVrJgtFkq) |

## 6. Reuse devnet SOL

The most sustainable way to save SOL is to reuse it. With the Solana CLI you can
show and close all previous buffer accounts with the following command:

```shell
solana program show --buffers
```

<Callout title="What's a buffer account?">

Buffer accounts are automatically created when you deploy a program. All the
program's data is transferred into this account during the deployment. When its
done, the data of your program is replaced with the new data.

</Callout>

Normally, these buffer accounts are closed automatically. In the event they are
not, you can close them manually to reclaim the SOL in them using the following
command:

```shell
solana program close <buffer account>
```

You can also the `show` subcommand to show all programs you deployed have
already deployed to your currently selected cluster:

```shell
solana program show --programs
```

You can then close each program with the `close` subcommand to close them and
retrieve the SOL you used to deploy them:

```shell
solana program close <program id>
```

You can then use that SOL to deploy new programs.

<Callout type="caution">

You will **NOT** able to use the same program id again once you closed the
program. So make sure are closing the right program and that you will not need
that id anymore.

If you get rate limited by the RPC endpoint your Solana CLI is configured to
use, you can add `-u "urlToYourRpc"` to the any of these command to use a
different RPC endpoint.

</Callout>
