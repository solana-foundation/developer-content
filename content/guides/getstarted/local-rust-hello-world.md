Rust is the most common programming language to write Solana programs with. This
quickstart guide will demonstrate how to quickly setup, build, and deploy your
first Rust based Solana program to the blockchain.

<Callout type="caution" title="Do you have the Solana CLI installed?">
This guide uses the Solana CLI and assumes you have setup your
local development environment. Checkout our
[local development quickstart guide](./setup-local-development.md) here to
quickly get setup.
</Callout>

## What you will learn

- how to install the Rust language locally
- how to initialize a new Solana Rust program
- how to code a basic Solana program in Rust
- how to build and deploy your Rust program

## Install Rust and Cargo

To be able to compile Rust based Solana programs, install the Rust language and
Cargo (the Rust package manager) using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Run your localhost validator

The Solana CLI comes with the
[test validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator) built in.
This command line tool will allow you to run a full blockchain cluster on your
machine.

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

<Callout title="PRO TIP">
Run the Solana test validator in a new/separate terminal window
that will remain open. This command line program must remain running for your
localhost validator to remain online and ready for action.
</Callout>

Configure your Solana CLI to use your localhost validator for all your future
terminal commands and Solana program deployment:

```shell
solana config set --url localhost
```

## Create a new Rust library with Cargo

Solana programs written in Rust are _libraries_ which are compiled to
[BPF bytecode](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/faq#berkeley-packet-filter-bpf)
and saved in the `.so` format.

Initialize a new Rust library named `hello_world` via the Cargo command line:

```shell
cargo init hello_world --lib
cd hello_world
```

Add the `solana-program` crate to your new Rust library:

```shell
cargo add solana-program
```

<Callout title="Pro Tip">
It is highly recommended to keep your `solana-program` and other
Solana Rust dependencies in-line with your installed version of the Solana
CLI. For example, if you are running Solana CLI `1.17.17`, you can instead
run:

```
cargo add solana-program@"=1.17.17"
```

This will ensure your crate uses only `1.17.17` and nothing else. If you
experience compatibility issues with Solana dependencies, check out the
[Solana Stack Exchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/9798/error-building-program-with-solana-program-v1-18-and-cli-v1-17/9799)

</Callout>

Open your `Cargo.toml` file and add these required Rust library configuration
settings, updating your project name as appropriate:

```toml
[lib]
name = "hello_world"
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

## Create your first Solana program

The code for your Rust based Solana program will live in your `src/lib.rs` file.
Inside `src/lib.rs` you will be able to import your Rust crates and define your
logic. Open your `src/lib.rs` file in your favorite editor.

At the top of `lib.rs`, import the `solana-program` crate and bring our needed
items into the local namespace:

```rust
use solana_program::{
    account_info::AccountInfo,
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    msg,
};
```

Every Solana program must define an `entrypoint` that tells the Solana runtime
where to start executing your on chain code. Your program's
[entrypoint](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#program-entrypoint)
should provide a public function named `process_instruction`:

```rust
// declare and export the program's entrypoint
entrypoint!(process_instruction);

// program entrypoint's implementation
pub fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8]
) -> ProgramResult {
    // log a message to the blockchain
    msg!("Hello, world!");

    // gracefully exit the program
    Ok(())
}
```

Every on chain program should return the `Ok`
[result enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) with a value of `()`. This
tells the Solana runtime that your program executed successfully without errors.

This program above will simply
[log a message](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/debugging#logging)
of "_Hello, world!_" to the blockchain cluster, then gracefully exit with
`Ok(())`.

## Build your Rust program

Inside a terminal window, you can build your Solana Rust program by running in
the root of your project (i.e. the directory with your `Cargo.toml` file):

```shell
cargo build-bpf
```

> After each time you build your Solana program, the above command will output
> the build path of your compiled program's `.so` file and the default keyfile
> that will be used for the program's address. `cargo build-bpf` installs the
> toolchain from the currently installed solana CLI tools. You may need to
> upgrade those tools if you encounter any version incompatibilities.

## Deploy your Solana program

Using the Solana CLI, you can deploy your program to your currently selected
cluster:

```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/hello_world.so
```

Once your Solana program has been deployed (and the transaction
[finalized](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/commitments)), the above command
will output your program's public address (aka its "program id").

```shell
# example output
Program Id: EFH95fWg49vkFNbAdw9vy75tM7sWZ2hQbTTUmuACGip3
```

#### Congratulations!

You have successfully setup, built, and deployed a Solana program using the Rust
language.

<Callout type="success" title="Check your wallet balance!">
Check your Solana wallet's balance again after you deployed. See how much
SOL it cost to deploy your simple program?
