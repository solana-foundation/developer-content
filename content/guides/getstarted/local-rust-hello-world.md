Rust is the most common programming language to write Solana programs with. This
quickstart guide will demonstrate how to quickly setup, build, and deploy your
first Rust based Solana program to the blockchain.

<Callout type="caution" title="Do you have the Solana CLI installed?">

This guide uses the Solana CLI and assumes you have setup your local development
environment. Checkout our
[local development quickstart guide](/content/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development.md)
here to quickly get setup.

## What you will learn

- how to install the Rust language locally
- how to initialize a new Solana Rust program
- how to code a basic Solana program in Rust
- how to build and deploy your Rust program

## Install Rust and Cargo

To be able to compile Rust based Solana programs, install the Rust language and
Cargo (the Rust package manager) using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Run your localhost validator

The Solana CLI comes with the
[test validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator) built in.
This command line tool will allow you to run a full blockchain cluster on your
machine.

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

<Callout title="PRO TIP">
Run the Solana test validator in a new/separate terminal window
that will remain open. This command line program must remain running for your
localhost validator to remain online and ready for action.
</Callout>

Configure your Solana CLI to use your localhost validator for all your future
terminal commands and Solana program deployment:

```shell
solana config set --url localhost
```

## Create a new Rust library with Cargo

Solana programs written in Rust are _libraries_ which are compiled to
[BPF bytecode](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/faq#berkeley-packet-filter-bpf)
and saved in the `.so` format.

Initialize a new Rust library named `hello_world` via the Cargo command line:

```shell
cargo init hello_world --lib
cd hello_world
```

Add the `solana-program` crate to your new Rust library:

```shell
cargo add solana-program
```

<Callout title="Pro Tip">
It is highly recommended to keep your `solana-program` and other
Solana Rust dependencies in-line with your installed version of the Solana
CLI. For example, if you are running Solana CLI `2.0.3`, you can instead
run:

```
cargo add solana-program@"=2.0.3"
```

This will ensure your crate uses only `2.0.3` and nothing else. If you
experience compatibility issues with Solana dependencies, check out the
[Solana Stack Exchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/9798/error-building-program-with-solana-program-v1-18-and-cli-v1-17/9799)

</Callout>

Open your `Cargo.toml` file and add these required Rust library configuration
settings, updating your project name as appropriate:

```toml
[lib]
name = "hello_world"
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

## Create your first Solana program

The code for your Rust based Solana program will live in your `src/lib.rs` file.
Inside `src/lib.rs` you will be able to import your Rust crates and define your
logic. Open your `src/lib.rs` file in your favorite editor.

At the top of `lib.rs`, import the `solana-program` crate and bring our needed
items into the local namespace:

```rust
use solana_program::{
    account_info::AccountInfo,
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    msg,
};
```

Every Solana program must define an `entrypoint` that tells the Solana runtime
where to start executing your onchain code. Your program's
[entrypoint](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#program-entrypoint)
should provide a public function named `process_instruction`:

```rust
// declare and export the program's entrypoint
entrypoint!(process_instruction);

// program entrypoint's implementation
pub fn process_instruction(
    _program_id: &Pubkey,
    _accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    _instruction_data: &[u8]
) -> ProgramResult {
    // log a message to the blockchain
    msg!("Hello, world!");

    // gracefully exit the program
    Ok(())
}
```

Every onchain program should return the `Ok`
[result enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) with a value of `()`. This
tells the Solana runtime that your program executed successfully without errors.

This program above will simply
[log a message](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/debugging#logging)
of "_Hello, world!_" to the blockchain cluster, then gracefully exit with
`Ok(())`.

## Build your Rust program

Inside a terminal window, you can build your Solana Rust program by running in
the root of your project (i.e. the directory with your `Cargo.toml` file):

```shell
cargo build-sbf
```

> After each time you build your Solana program, the above command will output
> the build path of your compiled program's `.so` file and the default keyfile
> that will be used for the program's address. `cargo build-sbf` installs the
> toolchain from the currently installed solana CLI tools. You may need to
> upgrade those tools if you encounter any version incompatibilities. In case
> you get an error like:
> `error while loading shared libraries: librustc_driver-278a6e01e221f788.so`you
> may need to go to `~/.cache/solana/` and `rm -rf` the platform tools there and
> then run `cargo build-sbf` again.

## Deploy your Solana program

Using the Solana CLI, you can deploy your program to your currently selected
cluster:

```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/hello_world.so
```

Once your Solana program has been deployed (and the transaction
[finalized](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/commitments)), the above command
will output your program's public address (aka its "program id").

```shell
# example output
Program Id: EFH95fWg49vkFNbAdw9vy75tM7sWZ2hQbTTUmuACGip3
```

#### Congratulations!

You have successfully setup, built, and deployed a Solana program using the Rust
language.

<Callout type="success" title="Look at your program!">
You can use the [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/) to look at your newly deployed program. 
The explorer also works on localnet, you can open the [Solana Explorer on localnet](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom) and just paste your programId in the search bar. 
</Callout>

## Let's call the Hello World program

Now that the program is deployed we want to call it to see the actual "Hello
World" on chain. For that we will use Javascript and the `Solana web3.js`
library.

### Install Node.js

To use node in WSL2 on Windows, please follow this  
[guide to installing node in WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl) to install node.

```shell
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

reopen the terminal

```shell
nvm install --lts
node --version
```

For macOS you can
[install node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

### Create the client file

Install the Solana web3.js library and the Solana helpers library:

```shell
npm install @solana/web3.js @solana-developers/helpers
```

Create a new file called `client.mjs` and add the following code:

```javascript
import {
  Connection,
  PublicKey,
  Transaction,
  TransactionInstruction,
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getKeypairFromFile } from "@solana-developers/helpers";

const programId = new PublicKey("YOUR_PROGRAM_ID");

// Connect to a solana cluster. Either to your local test validator or to devnet
const connection = new Connection("http://localhost:8899", "confirmed");
//const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com", "confirmed");

// We load the keypair that we created in a previous step
const keyPair = await getKeypairFromFile("~/.config/solana/id.json");

// Every transaction requires a blockhash
const blockhashInfo = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();

// Create a new transaction
const tx = new Transaction({
  ...blockhashInfo,
});

// Add our Hello World instruction
tx.add(
  new TransactionInstruction({
    programId: programId,
    keys: [],
    data: Buffer.from([]),
  }),
);

// Sign the transaction with your previously created keypair
tx.sign(keyPair);

// Send the transaction to the Solana network
const txHash = await connection.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());

console.log("Transaction sent with hash:", txHash);

await connection.confirmTransaction({
  blockhash: blockhashInfo.blockhash,
  lastValidBlockHeight: blockhashInfo.lastValidBlockHeight,
  signature: txHash,
});

console.log(
  `Congratulations! Look at your ‘Hello World’ transaction in the Solana Explorer:
  https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${txHash}?cluster=custom`,
);
```

> Don't forget to replace `YOUR_PROGRAM_ID` with the program ID you got from the
> deployment step.

### Run the client

Now lets use `node` run this file to see the "Hello World" on chain.

```shell
node client.mjs
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
Congratulations! Look at your ‘Hello World’ transaction in the Solana Explorer:
  https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2fTcQ74z4DVi8WRuf2oNZ36z7k9tGRThaRPXBMYgjMUNUbUSKLrP6djpRUZ8msuTXvZHFe3UXi31dfgytG2aJZbv?cluster=custom
```

<Callout type="success" title="Congrats">
If you follow the link you should be able to see your 'Hello World' transaction on the Solana explorer.
</Callout>

## Deploy to Solana devnet

Now you have successfully deployed your program to your local cluster. If you
want to deploy it to the public devnet to show your program to your friends you
can do so by running the following command:

```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/hello_world.so --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Then change the connections url in your `client.mjs` also to
`https://api.devnet.solana.com` and run the client again.

```shell
node client.mjs
```

You should see the same output as before but now on the public devnet cluster.
You can see the transaction in the
[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) again. Now you
just need to switch it to devnet on the top right.

Congratulations, now everyone in the world can see your "Hello World"
transaction on the Solana blockchain.
