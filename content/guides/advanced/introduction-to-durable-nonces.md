## Durable Nonce Applications

Before we dive deep into Durable Nonces, its important to understand that
durable nonces provide an opportunity to create and sign a transaction that can
be submitted at any point in the future, and much more. This opens up a wide
range of use cases that are otherwise not possible or too difficult to
implement:

1. **Scheduled Transactions**: One of the most apparent applications of Durable
   Nonces is the ability to schedule transactions. Users can pre-sign a
   transaction and then submit it at a later date, allowing for planned
   transfers, contract interactions, or even executing pre-determined investment
   strategies.

2. **Multisig Wallets**: Durable Nonces are very useful for multi-signature
   wallets where one party signs a transaction, and others may confirm at a
   later time. This feature enables the proposal, review, and later execution of
   a transaction within a trustless system.

3. **Programs Requiring Future Interaction**: If a program on Solana requires
   interaction at a future point (such as a vesting contract or a timed release
   of funds), a transaction can be pre-signed using a Durable Nonce. This
   ensures the contract interaction happens at the correct time without
   necessitating the presence of the transaction creator.

4. **Cross-chain Interactions**: When you need to interact with another
   blockchain, and it requires waiting for confirmations, you could sign the
   transaction with a Durable Nonce and then execute it once the required
   confirmations are received.

5. **Decentralized Derivatives Platforms**: In a decentralized derivatives
   platform, complex transactions might need to be executed based on specific
   triggers. With Durable Nonces, these transactions can be pre-signed and
   executed when the trigger condition is met.

## Introduction to Durable Nonces

### Double Spend

Imagine you're buying an NFT on MagicEden or Tensor. You have to sign a
transaction that allows the marketplace's program to extract some SOL from your
wallets.

What is stopping them from reusing your signature to extract SOL again? Without
a way to check if the transaction was already submitted once, they can keep
submitting the signed transaction until there's no SOL left in their wallet.

This is known as the problem of Double-Spend and is one of the core issues that
blockchains like Solana solve.

A naive solution could be to crosscheck all transactions made in the past and
see if we find the signature there. This is not practically possible, as the
size of the Solana ledger is >80 TB.

### Recent Blockhashes

Solution: Crosscheck signatures within only a set period of recent time, and
discard the transaction if it gets "too" old.

Recent Blockhashes are used to achieve this. A blockhash contains a 32-byte
SHA-256 hash. It is used to indicate when a client last observed the ledger.
Using recent blockhashes, transactions are checked in the last 150 blocks. If
they are found, they are rejected. They are also rejected if they get older than
150 blocks. The only case they are accepted is if they are unique and the
blockhash is more recent than 150 blocks (~80-90 seconds).

As you can imagine, a side-effect of using recent blockhashes is the forced
mortality of a transaction even before its submission.

Another issue with blockhashes is the forced non-uniqueness of signed
transactions in very small timeframes. In some cases, if the transactions are
executed very quickly in succession, some get the same recent blockhashes with
high probability, thus
[making them duplicate and avoid their execution](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/1161/how-to-avoid-sendtransactionerror-this-transaction-has-already-been-processed?rq=1).

To summarize:

1. What if I don't want to send the transaction right away?
2. What if I want to sign the transaction offline as I don't want to keep my
   keys on a device that is connected to the net?
3. What if I want to co-sign the transaction from multiple devices owned by
   multiple people, and the co-signing takes more than 90 seconds, like in a
   case of a multi-sig operated by a DAO?
4. What if I want to sign and send a burst of transactions and don't want them
   to fail due to duplication?

The solution lies with Durable Nonces⚡️

### Durable Nonces

Durable Transaction Nonces, which are 32-byte in length (usually represented as
base58 encoded strings), are used in place of recent blockhashes to make every
transaction unique (to avoid double-spending) while removing the mortality on
the unexecuted transaction.

Let's look at a couple of accounts that are important for using durable nonces
with Solana transactions.

### Nonce Account

The Nonce Account is the account that stores the value of the nonce. This
account is owned by the `SystemProgram` and is rent-exempt; thus needs to
maintain the minimum balance for rent exemption (around 0.0015 SOL).

### Nonce Authority

Nonce authority is the account that controls the Nonce Account. It has the
authority to generate a new nonce, advance the nonce or withdraw SOL from the
Nonce Account. By default, the account that creates the Nonce Account is
delegated as the Nonce Authority, but it's possible to transfer the authority
onto a keypair account or a PDA.

---

Now that we know what Durable Nonces are, it's time to use them to send durable
transactions.

## Durable Nonces with Solana CLI

### Create Nonce Authority

Let's start with creating a new keypair which we will use as our Nonce
authority. We can use the keypair currently configured in our Solana CLI, but
it's better to make a fresh one (make sure you're on devnet).

```shell
solana-keygen new -o nonce-authority.json
```

Set the current Solana CLI keypair to `nonce-authority.json` and airdrop some
SOL in it.

```shell
solana config set -k ~/<path>/nonce-authority.json
solana airdrop 2
```

Okay, we're set. Let's create our nonce account.

### Create Nonce Account

Create a new keypair `nonce-account` and use the `create-nonce-account`
instruction to delegate this keypair as the Nonce Account. We will also transfer
0.0015 SOL to the Nonce Account from the Nonce Authority, which is usually just
above the minimum quantity needed for rent exemption.

```shell
solana-keygen new -o nonce-account.json
solana create-nonce-account nonce-account.json 0.0015
```

Output

```shell
Signature: skkfzUQrZF2rcmrhAQV6SuLa7Hj3jPFu7cfXAHvkVep3Lk3fNSVypwULhqMRinsa6Zj5xjj8zKZBQ1agMxwuABZ
```

Upon searching the
[signature](https://solscan.io/tx/skkfzUQrZF2rcmrhAQV6SuLa7Hj3jPFu7cfXAHvkVep3Lk3fNSVypwULhqMRinsa6Zj5xjj8zKZBQ1agMxwuABZ?cluster=devnet)
on the explorer, we can see that the Nonce Account was created and the
`InitializeNonce` instruction was used to initialize a nonce within the account.

### Fetch Nonce

We can query the value of the stored Nonce as follows.

```shell
solana nonce nonce-account.json
```

Output

```shell
AkrQn5QWLACSP5EMT2R1ZHyKaGWVFrDHJ6NL89HKtwjQ
```

This is the base58 encoded hash that will be used in place of recent blockhashes
while signing a transaction.

### Displace Nonce Account

We can inspect the details of a Nonce Account in a prettier formatted version

```shell
solana nonce-account nonce-account.json
```

Output

```shell
Balance: 0.0015 SOL
Minimum Balance Required: 0.00144768 SOL
Nonce blockhash: AkrQn5QWLACSP5EMT2R1ZHyKaGWVFrDHJ6NL89HKtwjQ
Fee: 5000 lamports per signature
Authority: 5CZKcm6PakaRWGK8NogzXvj8CjA71uSofKLohoNi4Wom
```

### Advancing Nonce

As discussed before, advancing the Nonce or changing the value of the nonce is
an important step for making subsequent transactions unique. The Nonce Authority
needs to sign the transaction with the `nonceAdvance` instruction.

```shell
solana new-nonce nonce-account.json
```

Output

```shell
Signature: 4nMHnedguiEtHshuMEm3NsuTQaeV8AdcDL6QSndTZLK7jcLUag6HCiLtUq6kv21yNSVQLoFj44aJ5sZrTXoYYeyS
```

If we check the nonce again, the value of the nonce has changed or advanced.

```shell
solana nonce nonce-account.json
```

Output

```shell
DA8ynAQTGctqQXNS2RNTGpag6s5p5RcrBm2DdHhvpRJ8
```

### Withdraw from Nonce Account

We transferred 0.0015 SOL when creating the Nonce Account. The Nonce Authority
can transfer these funds back to itself or some other account.

```shell
solana withdraw-from-nonce-account nonce-account.json nonce-authority.json 0.0000001
```

Output

```shell
Signature: 5zuBmrUpqnubdePHVgzSNThbocruJZLJK5Dut7DM6WyoqW4Qbrc26uCw3nq6jRocR9XLMwZZ79U54HDnGhDJVNfF
```

We can check the status of the Nonce Account after the withdrawal; the balance
should have changed.

```shell
solana nonce-account nonce-account.json
```

Output

```shell
Balance: 0.0014999 SOL
Minimum Balance Required: 0.00144768 SOL
Nonce blockhash: DA8ynAQTGctqQXNS2RNTGpag6s5p5RcrBm2DdHhvpRJ8
Fee: 5000 lamports per signature
Authority: 5CZKcm6PakaRWGK8NogzXvj8CjA71uSofKLohoNi4Wom
```

## Live Example: DAO Offline Co-Signing

We will use an example where a DAO committee needs to transfer some SOL to a new
wallet. Two co-signers are needed before sending the SOL, where `co-sender` pays
for the transaction and `sender` sends the SOL. To add to this, the `co-sender`
is very careful when it comes to connecting his device to the internet and thus
wants to sign the transaction offline.

Let's create three new keypairs, which will act as the two members of the DAO
and the receiver. Although, for this example, we are creating the keypairs in
the same system, we will assume that these accounts are on different systems to
replicate an IRL scenario.

```shell
solana-keygen new -o sender.json
# pubkey: H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51

solana-keygen new -o co-sender.json
# pubkey: HDx43xY4piU3xMxNyRQkj89cqiF15hz5FVW9ergTtZ7S

solana-keygen new -o receiver.json
# pubkey: D3RAQxwQBhMLum2WK7eCn2MpRWgeLtDW7fqXTcqtx9uC
```

Let's add some SOL to the member wallets.

```shell
solana airdrop -k sender.json 0.5
solana airdrop -k co-sender.json 0.5
```

### Using Recent Blockhashes

Before we try to sign and send a durable transaction, let's see how transactions
are normally submitted using recent blockhashes.

> Its important to note that although we'll attempt to achieve the above using
> recent blockhashes, the expected outcome is failure, which will help us
> appreciate why durable nonces are necessary here.

The first step is to build a transfer transaction from `sender` to `receiver`
and sign it with `co-sender`'s wallet.

To sign an offline transaction, we need to use:

1. `--sign-only`: which prevents clients from sending the transaction.
2. `--blockhash`: which lets us specify a recent blockhash so that the client
   does not try to fetch for it in an offline setting.

- We can get a recent blockhash from
  [solscan](https://solscan.io/blocks?cluster=devnet). Just copy the first
  blockhash from the list.
- We will also need the pubkey of `sender`:
  `H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51`
- You can even turn off your internet when you sign this transaction using the
  `co-sender`'s wallet :).

```shell
solana transfer receiver.json 0.1 \
  --sign-only \
  --blockhash F13BkBgNTyyuruUQFSgUkXPMJCfPvKhhrr217eiqGfVE \
  --fee-payer co-sender.json \
  --from H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51 \
  --keypair co-sender.json
```

Output

```shell
Blockhash: F13BkBgNTyyuruUQFSgUkXPMJCfPvKhhrr217eiqGfVE
Signers (Pubkey=Signature):
 HDx43xY4piU3xMxNyRQkj89cqiF15hz5FVW9ergTtZ7S=2gUmcb4Xwm3Dy9xH3a3bePsWVKCRMtUghqDS9pnGZDmX6hqtWMfpubEbgcai5twncoAJzyr9FRn3yuXVeSvYD4Ni
Absent Signers (Pubkey):
 H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51
```

The transaction is signed by `co-sender`'s wallet, who will pay the tx fee.
Also, we are notified about the pending signature from the `sender`'s wallet
(`H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51`).

In a real-world scenario, `co-sender` can share their `Pubkey=Signature` pair
with the `sender` who will need this sign and submit the transaction. This share
may take more than a minute to happen. Once the `sender` receives this pair,
they can initiate the transfer.

```shell
solana transfer receiver.json 0.1 \
  --allow-unfunded-recipient \
  --blockhash F13BkBgNTyyuruUQFSgUkXPMJCfPvKhhrr217eiqGfVE \
  --from sender.json \
  --keypair sender.json \
  --signer HDx43xY4piU3xMxNyRQkj89cqiF15hz5FVW9ergTtZ7S=2gUmcb4Xwm3Dy9xH3a3bePsWVKCRMtUghqDS9pnGZDmX6hqtWMfpubEbgcai5twncoAJzyr9FRn3yuXVeSvYD4Ni
```

Output

```shell
Error: Hash has expired F13BkBgNTyyuruUQFSgUkXPMJCfPvKhhrr217eiqGfVE
```

The transfer is not successful because the hash has expired. How do we overcome
this issue of expired blockhashes? Using Durable Nonces!

### Using Durable Nonces

We will use the `nonce-account.json` and `nonce-authority.json` keypairs that we
created earlier. We already have a nonce initialized in the `nonce-account`.
Let's advance it to get a new one first, just to be sure that the `nonce` isn't
already used.

```shell
solana new-nonce nonce-account.json
solana nonce-account nonce-account.json
```

Output

```shell
Signature: 3z1sSU7fmdRoBZynVLiJEqa97Ja481nb3r1mLu8buAgwMnaKdF4ZaiBkzrLjPRzn1HV2rh4AHQTJHAQ3DsDiYVpF

Balance: 0.0014999 SOL
Minimum Balance Required: 0.00144768 SOL
Nonce blockhash: HNUi6La2QpGJdfcAR6yFFmdgYoCvFZREkve2haMBxXVz
Fee: 5000 lamports per signature
Authority: 5CZKcm6PakaRWGK8NogzXvj8CjA71uSofKLohoNi4Wom
```

Perfect, now let's start with offline co-signing the transaction with
`co-signer`'s wallet, but this time, we'll use the `Nonce blockhash` printed
above, which is basically the `nonce` stored in the `nonce-account` as the
blockhash for the transfer transaction.

```shell
solana transfer receiver.json 0.1 \
  --sign-only \
  --nonce nonce-account.json \
  --blockhash HNUi6La2QpGJdfcAR6yFFmdgYoCvFZREkve2haMBxXVz \
  --fee-payer co-sender.json \
  --from H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51 \
  --keypair co-sender.json
```

Output

```shell
Blockhash: HNUi6La2QpGJdfcAR6yFFmdgYoCvFZREkve2haMBxXVz
Signers (Pubkey=Signature):
 HDx43xY4piU3xMxNyRQkj89cqiF15hz5FVW9ergTtZ7S=5tfuPxsXchbVFU745658nsQr5Gqhb5nRnZKLnnovJ2PZBHbqUbe7oB5kDbnq7tjeJ2V8Mywa4gujUjT4BWKRcAdi
Absent Signers (Pubkey):
 H8BHbivzT4DtJxL4J4X53CgnqzTUAEJfptSaEHsCvg51
```

This is very similar to the one we signed using the recent blockhash. Now we'll
sign and send the transaction with the `sender`'s wallet.

```shell
solana transfer receiver.json 0.1 \
  --nonce nonce-account.json \
  --nonce-authority nonce-authority.json \
  --blockhash HNUi6La2QpGJdfcAR6yFFmdgYoCvFZREkve2haMBxXVz \
  --from sender.json \
  --keypair sender.json \
  --signer HDx43xY4piU3xMxNyRQkj89cqiF15hz5FVW9ergTtZ7S=5tfuPxsXchbVFU745658nsQr5Gqhb5nRnZKLnnovJ2PZBHbqUbe7oB5kDbnq7tjeJ2V8Mywa4gujUjT4BWKRcAdi
```

Output

```shell
Signature: anQ8VtQgeSMoKTnQCubTenq1J7WKxAa1dbFMDLsbDWgV6GGL135G1Ydv4QTNd6GptP3TxDQ2ZWi3Y5qnEtjM7yg
```

The transaction is successfully submitted!

If we check it on the
[explorer](https://solscan.io/tx/anQ8VtQgeSMoKTnQCubTenq1J7WKxAa1dbFMDLsbDWgV6GGL135G1Ydv4QTNd6GptP3TxDQ2ZWi3Y5qnEtjM7yg?cluster=devnet),
we can see that an `AdvanceNonce` instruction was prepended to the transaction,
as we discussed before. This is done to avoid using the same nonce again.

Voila, we've gone through a very real-life use case of Durable Nonces. Now let's
see how to use them in transactions using JavaScript and the
[`@solana/web3.js`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) package.

## Durable Nonces with Solana `web3.js`

We'll use a similar example of making a simple transfer to demonstrate how to
send transactions using durable nonces.

### Create Nonce Authority

```JS
const nonceAuthKP = Keypair.generate();
// airdrop some SOL into this account from https://solfaucet.com/
```

### Create Nonce Accounts

```JS
const nonceKeypair = Keypair.generate();
const tx = new Transaction();

// the fee payer can be any account
tx.feePayer = nonceAuthKP.publicKey;

// to create the nonce account, you can use fetch the recent blockhash
// or use a nonce from a different, pre-existing nonce account
tx.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getLatestBlockhash()).blockhash;

tx.add(
    // create system account with the minimum amount needed for rent exemption.
    // NONCE_ACCOUNT_LENGTH is the space a nonce account takes
    SystemProgram.createAccount({
        fromPubkey: nonceAuthKP.publicKey,
        newAccountPubkey: nonceKeypair.publicKey,
        lamports: 0.0015 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
        space: NONCE_ACCOUNT_LENGTH,
        programId: SystemProgram.programId,
    }),
    // initialise nonce with the created nonceKeypair's pubkey as the noncePubkey
    // also specify the authority of the nonce account
    SystemProgram.nonceInitialize({
        noncePubkey: nonceKeypair.publicKey,
        authorizedPubkey: nonceAuthKP.publicKey,
    })
);

// sign the transaction with both the nonce keypair and the authority keypair
tx.sign(nonceKeypair, nonceAuthKP);

// send the transaction
const sig = await sendAndConfirmRawTransaction(
    connection,
    tx.serialize({requireAllSignatures: false})
);
console.log("Nonce initiated: ", sig);
```

### Fetch Initialised Nonce Account

```JS
const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(nonceKeypair.publicKey);
const nonceAccount = NonceAccount.fromAccountData(accountInfo.data);
```

### Sign Transaction using Durable Nonce

```JS
// make a system transfer instruction
const ix = SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: publicKey,
    toPubkey: publicKey,
    lamports: 100,
});

// make a nonce advance instruction
const advanceIX = SystemProgram.nonceAdvance({
    authorizedPubkey: nonceAuthKP.publicKey,
    noncePubkey: noncePubKey
})

// add them to a transaction
const tx = new Transaction();
tx.add(advanceIX);
tx.add(ix);

// use the nonceAccount's stored nonce as the recentBlockhash
tx.recentBlockhash = nonceAccount.nonce;
tx.feePayer = publicKey;

// sign the tx with the nonce authority's keypair
tx.sign(nonceAuthKP);

// make the owner of the publicKey sign the transaction
// this should open a wallet popup and let the user sign the tx
const signedTx = await signTransaction(tx);

// once you have the signed tx, you can serialize it and store it
// in a database, or send it to another device. You can submit it
// at a later point, without the tx having a mortality
const serialisedTx = bs58.encode(signedTx.serialize({requireAllSignatures: false}));
console.log("Signed Durable Transaction: ", serialisedTx);
```

## Live Example: Poll Simulation App

The Poll Simulation app simulates a real-life poll mechanism, wherein voters are
allowed to vote for a given set of times. Once the time comes for determining
the results of the poll: the votes are counted, the count is publicly announced
to everyone, and the winner is declared.

This is tough to build on-chain, as changing the state of an account on-chain is
a public action, and hence if a user votes for someone, others would know, and
hence the count won't be hidden from the public until the voting has been
completed.

Durable nonces can be used to partially fix this. Instead of signing and sending
the transaction when voting for your candidate, the dapp can let the user sign
the transaction using durable nonces, serialize the transaction as shown above
in the web3.js example, and save the serialized transactions in a database until
the time comes for counting.

For counting the votes, the dapp then needs to sync, send, or submit all the
signed transactions one by one. With each submitted transaction, the state
change will happen on-chain, and the winner can be decided.
