This guide will lead you through the process of integrating Solana wallet
adapter in NextJS and using Solana wallets in your application.

We will cover:

- Creating a new Next.js project
- Installing Solana wallet adapter dependencies
- Setting up Solana wallet adapter in your Next.js app
- Adding a connect wallet button
- Utilizing the wallet context in other Next.js pages, using the `useConnection`
  and `useWallet` hooks

> You can quickly generate a fast, ready-to-go production NextJS project with
> the Solana wallet adapter already configured using the
> `npx create-solana-dapp@latest` CLI tool. This tool allows anyone to generate
> a customized Solana dApp scaffold, including pre-configured Solana program
> templates ready for you to add your custom logic.

## 1. Create a Next.js project

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use
React components to build user interfaces and Next.js for additional features
and optimizations.

You will need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) in order to
create a Next.js app. We can execute this command, which will create a basic
scaffold for us:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

It will ask you questions about the project name, Typescript, ESlint, tailwind
CSS, src directory, using App router or not, and customizing the default import
alias. For this guide, we will use all the default and recommended options for
now, including using App router.

This is how the directory structure will look like after creating the scaffold:

```
├── src
│   └── app
│       ├── favicon.ico
│       ├── globals.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
```

## 2. Installing Solana Wallet Adapter

In order to allow our applications users connect their favorite Solana wallet,
we will need to install and use the various Solana wallet adapter packages.
These packages contain essential functions, hooks, and React components required
to integrate Solana wallets into our NextJS app.

To allow for better composability and smaller production builds, the "standard
wallet adapter" functionality is split into a few different packages:

- `@solana/wallet-adapter-base` includes functions that detect wallets the user
  has installed and sign/send transactions from a wallet
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` includes the functionality to help manage the
  user's wallet state within your React based application, including giving
  access to hooks like `useConnection` and `useWallet`
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` provides several base UI components related
  to wallet operations, including a wallet connect/disconnect button and wallet
  selection modal contexts and providers

Install these packages to your Next.js project using your preferred node package
manager:

```shell
npm install @solana/web3.js \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-base \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets \
```

## 3. Setting up Wallet Adapter in your Next.js app

This section will help you set up the Next.js app so that we can use all the
Solana wallet features inside all the future pages you create.

Create a `components` folder and add a file named `AppWalletProvider.tsx`. We
will export the contents of this file to be used
inside [the root layout file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts).

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
├── src
│   └── app
│       ├── components
│       │   └── AppWalletProvider.tsx
│       ├── favicon.ico
│       ├── globals.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
```

### AppWalletProvider.tsx

The goal of this file will be to export a
[context provider](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) as
a react component that will help us “teleport” data and to use (or change)
within all of the context's children components. Effectively allowing all this
context's children to easily access all the Solana wallet adapter functionality
and facilitate user wallet interactions within your application.

> This `AppWalletProvider.tsx` file we are creating will be rendered on the
> **client side**, NOT the server side. So we will need to add the
> `"use client"` directive to the top of the file to make sure NextJS renders
> our context and children on the client side.

First, we will need to import all the dependencies into the file, including the
standard context providers from the wallet adapter packages like
`connectionProvider` and `WalletProvider`.

- `WalletAdapterNetwork` is an enum that defines default network values like
  `mainnet-beta`, `testnet`, and `devnet`.
- the `WalletModalProvider` from `@solana/wallet-adapter-base` has the context
  of a "connect wallet" button. This button helps you toggle the connect wallet
  modal component's visibility, allowing your users to select their Solana
  wallet to connect to your application.
- `UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter` is a react component shipped by the wallet adapter
  maintainers for testing wallets. This Burner Wallet is the default wallet
  adapter used in the starter packs. This adapter implements the Wallet Adapter
  interface but uses an unsafe local keypair to sign messages.

Since we are using the standard wallet adapter UI components, we also must
import the provided standard CSS styles required for these react components to
be displayed properly in our application. Each of these styles can be easily
overridden to customize the look.

Let’s import these dependencies and use them further in the context/provider
component we are building:

```tsx filename=AppWalletProvider.tsx
"use client";

import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import {
  ConnectionProvider,
  WalletProvider,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-base";
import { WalletModalProvider } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";
import { clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";
// import { UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets";

// Default styles that can be overridden by your app
require("@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css");
```

### Supported wallets and "wallet standard"

There are two ways to support the various Solana wallets your user's will want
to use within your application:

1. Wallets with
   [wallet-standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard)
   implementation. These wallets will be automatically detected with
   `@solana/wallet-adapter-base` and do not require you to add any extra code
   into your application for users to use them.
2. Wallets
   with [legacy wallet adapters](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/master/PACKAGES.md#wallets) are
   bundled in an npm package. To support these wallets within your application,
   you must install and import each of these wallet's legacy adapters into your
   application.

The most popular Solana wallets already conform to and implement
`wallet-standard`. So for your user's to use these popular Solana wallets, you
do not need to do anything special within your application. They will work
automatically and be shown to your users (including
[Solana Mobile Stack Wallet Adapter](https://www.notion.so/Integrate-solana-wallets-to-your-NextJS-webapp-60e34961b0174982859b4cb9973b2723?pvs=21)).
If there is a specific, non-standard wallet that your users want your
application to support, that is when we recommend manually adding it's legacy
adapter.

### Setup the AppWalletProvider

Our `AppWalletProvider` component will be used to facilitate the connection to
the desired Solana network cluster (i.e. `devnet`, `mainnet-beta`, etc) via our
desired RPC endpoint. This RPC endpoint will be where our application sends the
transactions. In our guide here, we are hardcoded here to use the `devnet`
network cluster.

In this example, we are also defining an array called `wallets`. This array
contains any of the legacy wallet adapter wallets you desire to import and
support within your application. Again though, you will likely not need to have
any entries in this array.

```tsx filename=AppWalletProvider.tsx
// imports here

export default function AppWalletProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
  const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);
  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      // manually add any legacy wallet adapters here
      // new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter(),
    ],
    [network],
  );

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
      <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
        <WalletModalProvider>{children}</WalletModalProvider>
      </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
}
```

We pass the `endpoint` and `wallets` variables into the `ConnectionProvider` and
`WalletProvider` as props to those providers given to us by the wallet adapter
packages. The `autoConnect` prop is the setting that declares whether your
application should attempt to auto connect to a user's previously connected
wallet when your application loads.

`WalletModalProvider` has a component called `WalletModal` which helps your
users select a wallet from a list of available and installed wallets in the
environment (i.e. their web browser). This provider will help that modal toggle
visibility in the children components.

### Wrap your application with AppWalletAdapter

With our `AppWalletAdapter` context setup and ready-to-go, we need to wrap our
NextJS application with this context to make its APIs, hooks, and state
accessible within the rest of our application and child pages.

Inside your root `layout.tsx`, import your `AppWalletAdapter` provider and pass
in the application's `children` as the children of the `AppWalletAdapter`
component:

```tsx filename=src/app/layout.tsx
import AppWalletProvider from "./components/AppWalletProvider";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <AppWalletProvider>{children}</AppWalletProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

With after the steps above completed and `AppWalletAdapter` setup properly, your
NextJS application is ready to start interacting with user wallets.

## 4. Connect wallet button

The "connect wallet" button is a common component that will allow your users to
open the "select wallet modal" and chose their desired Solana wallet to connect
to your application.

Normally, developers add this connect wallet button component to their primary
header component so that the connect button is viewable and accessible to on all
other pages. Enabling users to easily connect their wallet wherever they are
within your application. However, for the simplicity of this guide, we are
adding the wallet connect to the home page:

In your `page.tsx` at the root of your `app` folder, import the
`WalletMultiButton` from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`. Then, you can return
that button component from your home page component.

```tsx filename=src/app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { WalletMultiButton } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <div className="border hover:border-slate-900 rounded">
        <WalletMultiButton style={{}} />
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Now start your dev server and see the website served in your browser:

```bash
❯ npm run dev

> my-app@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

   ▲ Next.js 14.1.3
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000

 ✓ Ready in 3.1s
```

Here's a demo of how output should look in your browser with the default styles
provided from the wallet adapter packages:

## 5. useWallet and useConnection hooks

The most common ways your application will interact with your user's Solana
wallet is using the `useWallet` and `useConnection` hooks provided by the wallet
adapter packages and accessible to all child components of your
`AppWalletAdapter` context.

From the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` package, you can import the two hooks
named `useWallet` and `useConnection` that can be used anywhere on the client
side of your app that is a child of your `AppWalletAdapter` context. In this
example guide, it will be your entire application.

- the `useWallet` hook has details like `publicKey` and state of the wallet,
  whether it’s `connecting` or it’s `connected`.
- the `useConnection` hook will facilitate your application's connection to the
  Solana blockchain, via your RPC endpoint

> Solana uses the [JSON-RPC 2.0 spec](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) which is
> transport agnostic and can be implemented over HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, TCP,
> and other transports. This means you can use the `connection` object returned
> from the `useConnection` hook to get
> [WebSocket notifications](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/websocket) or
> [sending HTTP requests](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http).

### Performing an airdrop

Here's an example of getting a
[devnet SOL airdrop](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/solana-token-airdrop-and-faucets)
using the `connection` and `publicKey` from `useConnection` and `useWallet`
hooks.

This `getAirdropOnClick` function gets the latest
[blockhash](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions/confirmation#what-is-a-blockhash)
using the
[`getLatestBlockhash`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getlatestblockhash) RPC
method. It also gets the transaction signature from the
[`requestAirdrop`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/requestairdrop#parameters)
function from the `connection`. We can also verify whether the transaction
was [confirmed](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment) and
added to the block, ensuring the airdrop was successful and the SOL is available
for use.

```tsx
const { connection } = useConnection();
const { publicKey } = useWallet();

const getAirdropOnClick = async () => {
  try {
    if (!publicKey) {
      throw new Error("Wallet is not Connected");
    }
    const [latestBlockhash, signature] = await Promise.all([
      connection.getLatestBlockhash(),
      connection.requestAirdrop(publicKey, 1 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL),
    ]);
    const sigResult = await connection.confirmTransaction(
      { signature, ...latestBlockhash },
      "confirmed",
    );
    if (sigResult) {
      alert("Airdrop was confirmed!");
    }
  } catch (err) {
    alert("You are Rate limited for Airdrop");
  }
};
```

### Getting a wallet balance

Here’s an example of getting the SOL balance of the wallet connected using the
`useConnection` and `useWallet` hooks.

[`getBalance`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getbalance#parameters) is an RPC
HTTP method you can call from the `connection` object to get the SOL balance of
any Solana account (like a user's wallet). Calling this function with
`setTimeout` is good for checking the balance continuously every 10 seconds:

```tsx
const [balance, setBalance] = useState<number>(0);

useEffect(() => {
  if (publicKey) {
    (async function getBalanceEvery10Seconds() {
      const newBalance = await connection.getBalance(publicKey);
      setBalance(newBalance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
      setTimeout(getBalanceEvery10Seconds, 10000);
    })();
  }
}, [publicKey, connection, balance]);
```

### Interact with a wallet on a page

With functions like these and the ones provided within the wallet adapter
packages, you can detect whether the user's wallet is connected or not, create a
button to get an airdrop of devnet or sol in the network defined, and more.

Let’s make another page now to demonstrate how we can use each of these hooks to
access actually access the `connection` object and your user's wallet state to
send or sign transactions, read the wallet balance, and test functionality.

Create a new folder inside the `app` folder and name it `address`. Create a file
`page.tsx` inside that folder. In this example, our new page will be located at
`src/app/address/page.tsx`:

```bash
├── src
│   └── app
│       ├── address
│       │   └── page.tsx
│       ├── components
│       │   └── AppWalletProvider.tsx
│       ├── favicon.ico
│       ├── globals.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
```

In side of your new page, we can create use utilize the hooks and custom
function we discussed above to allow the user to actually perform these
interactions with their Solana wallet of choice:

```tsx filename=src/app/address/page.tsx
"use client";
import { useConnection, useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
import { LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Address() {
  const { connection } = useConnection();
  const { publicKey } = useWallet();
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState<number>(0);

  // code for the `getAirdropOnClick` function here

  // code for the `getBalanceEvery10Seconds` and useEffect code here

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-evenly p-24">
      {publicKey ? (
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
          <h1>Your Public key is: {publicKey?.toString()}</h1>
          <h2>Your Balance is: {balance} SOL</h2>
          <div>
            <button
              onClick={getAirdropOnClick}
              type="button"
              className="text-gray-900 bg-white border border-gray-300 focus:outline-none hover:bg-gray-100 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-100 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 me-2 mb-2 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white dark:border-gray-600 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:border-gray-600 dark:focus:ring-gray-700"
            >
              Get Airdrop
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <h1>Wallet is not connected</h1>
      )}
    </main>
  );
}
```

Here's what your address page will look like when the wallet is connected on the
home page.

![Example "address" page that uses the Solana wallet adapter hooks](/assets/guides/integrate-solana-wallets-into-nextjs/address-page.png)

## Next Steps

- You can use the `useWallet` hook to trigger a user's connected Solana wallet
  to ask then to sign a transaction or a plain message that your application
  provides to the wallet

- You can call [any RPC method](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) from the
  `connection` object (via the `useConnection` hook)

- You can also checkout the [Unified Wallet Kit](https://unified.jup.ag/) from
  the creators of [Jupiter](https://jup.ag). It is an open-sourced wallet
  adapter alternative that adds some extra functionality, striving for the best
  Solana wallet integration experience for developers and the best wallet
  experience for your users.

If you are creating a brand new application or project, you can also use the
`create-solana-dapp` CLI tool to generate a scaffold with the built-in Solana
wallet adapter. To scaffold a new application, run the CLI tool in your
terminal:

```shell
npx create-solana-dapp@latest
```

It will prompt you for common information (like your project name and desired
frontend framework) and will generate a customized project, fully configured
with Solana wallet adapter configured and ready for your users.
