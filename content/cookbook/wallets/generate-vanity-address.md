Vanity publickeys, or custom addresses, are keys that have start with specific
characters.

For example, a person may want a publickey to start with `elv1s`, or maybe even
`cook`. These can help other people remember who the key belongs to, making the
key more easily identifiable.

**Note**: The more characters in your vanity address, the longer it will take.

You can generate a vanity address using the
[Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli):

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with e1v1s:1
```
